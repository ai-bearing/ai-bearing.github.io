\begin{abstract}
  \noindent We discuss extremal structure in locally convex topological vector spaces, as well as a fundamental result in the theory of topological vector spaces: the Krein--Milman theorem. We also use extremal structure to prove the Stone--Weierstrass Theorem and the Banach--Stone theorem.
\end{abstract}
\section{Extremal Structure}%
We need to recall some basic ideas related to convexity and compactness in topological vector spaces.
\begin{theorem}
  If $A_1,\dots,A_n$ are compact convex sets in a topological vector space $X$, then $\operatorname{conv}\left( A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n \right)$ is compact.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\Delta_{n} = \operatorname{conv}\left( e_1,\dots,e_n \right)$ be the basic simplex in $\R^n$, where elements look like
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta_n &= \set{\left( s_1,\dots,s_n \right) | s_i\geq 0,\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_i = 1}.
  \end{align*}
  Define $A = A_1\times\cdots\times A_n$, and set $f\colon \Delta_n\times A \rightarrow X$ to be defined by $f\left( s,a \right) = \sum_{i}s_ia_i$. We set $K = f\left( S\times A \right)$.\newline

  Note that since $f$ is continuous (as addition and scalar multiplication are continuous), $\Delta_n$ is compact, and $A$ is compact, we have that $K$ is compact. Furthermore, $K\subseteq \operatorname{conv}\left( A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n \right)$. We will now show that the inclusion goes in the opposite direction.\newline

  We will do this by showing that $K$ is convex. Let $\left( s,a \right),\left( t,b \right)\in S\times A$, and let $0\leq q \leq 1$. Then, defining
  \begin{align*}
    u &= qs + \left( 1-q \right)t\\
    c_i &= \frac{qs_ia_i + \left( 1-q \right)t_ib_i}{qs_i + \left( 1-q \right)t_i},
  \end{align*}
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    qf\left( s,a \right) + \left( 1-q \right)f\left( t,b \right) &= f\left( u,c \right)\\
                                                                 &\in K,
  \end{align*}
  meaning $K$ is convex, so $\operatorname{conv}\left( A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n \right)\subseteq K$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  Let $K$ be a subset of a vector space $X$. A nonempty $S\subseteq K$ is called a \textit{face} for $K$ if the interior of any line in $K$ that is contained in $S$ contains its endpoints. Analytically, this means that if $x,y\in K$ are such that, for all $t\in (0,1)$, $tx + \left( 1-t \right)y\in S$, then $x,y\in S$.\newline

  An \textit{extreme point} of $K$ is an extreme set of $K$ that consists of one point. We write $\operatorname{ext}\left( K \right)$ for the extreme points of $K$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  Let $\Omega$ be a LCH space. The extreme points of the regular Borel probability measures on $\Omega$ are the Dirac measures. That is,
  \begin{align*}
    \operatorname{ext}\left( \mathcal{P}_{r}\left( \Omega \right) \right) &= \set{\delta_x | x\in\Omega}.
  \end{align*}
  In one direction, we see that if $x\in \Omega$, and $\delta_x = \frac{1}{2}\left( \mu + \nu \right)$, then for a Borel set $E\subseteq \Omega$ with $x\in E$, we have $1 = \frac{1}{2}\left( \mu\left( E \right) + \nu\left( E \right) \right)$. Therefore, $\mu(E)=\nu(E) = 1$. If $x\notin E$, then $0 = \frac{1}{2}\left( \mu\left( E \right) + \nu\left( E \right) \right)$, so $\mu(E) = \nu(E) = 0$. Thus, $\mu=\nu=\delta_x$, so every $\delta_x$ is extreme.\newline

  In the opposite direction, if $\mu\in \operatorname{ext}\left( \mathcal{P}_r\left( \Omega \right) \right)$, we claim that there is $x_0\in \Omega$ with $\supp\left( \mu \right) = \set{x_0}$. Now, since $\mu\left( \Omega \right) = 1$, we know that $\supp\left( \mu \right) \neq\emptyset$.\newline

  Suppose there exist $x,y\in \supp\left( \mu \right)$ with $x\neq y$. Since $\Omega$ is Hausdorff, we can separate $x,y\in \supp\left( \mu \right)$ with disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$, where $0 < \mu\left( U \right) < 1$ and $0 < \mu\left( V \right) < 1$. Set $t = \mu\left( U \right)$, and define
  \begin{align*}
    \mu_1\left( E \right) &= \frac{\mu\left( E\cap U \right)}{\mu\left( U \right)}\\
    \mu_2\left( E \right) &= \frac{\mu\left( E^{c} \right)}{\mu\left( U^{c} \right)}.
  \end{align*}
  Then, $\mu_1,\mu_2$ are regular Borel probability measures with $\mu_1\neq \mu_2$ and $t\mu_1 + \left( 1-t \right)\mu_2 = \mu$, which contradicts $\mu$ being extreme. Therefore, $\supp\left( \mu \right) = \set{x_0}$, so $\mu = \delta_{x_0}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  The picture of a face in a convex compact set is relatively simple. If $u\colon X\rightarrow \R$ is an $\R$-linear continuous functional, and $P\subseteq X$ is compact and convex, the infimum $\inf_{x\in P}u(x) \eqcolon s$ is attained. The subset
  \begin{align*}
    P_u &= \set{x\in P | u(x) = s}
  \end{align*}
  is a closed face in $P$.\newline

  To start, $P_u$ is nonempty because the infimum is attained. Since $u$ is continuous, $P_u$ is closed. Furthermore, if $t\in [0,1]$ and $x,y\in P_u$, then $\left( 1-t \right)x + ty\in P_u$, as
  \begin{align*}
    u\left( \left( 1-t \right)x + ty \right) &= \left( 1-t \right)u(x) + tu(y)\\
                                             &= \left( 1-t \right)s = ts\\
                                             &= s.
  \end{align*}
  Now, if $t\in (0,1)$ and $x,y\in P$ with $\left( 1-t \right)x + ty\in P_u$, then
  \begin{align*}
    s &= \left( 1-t \right)u(x) + tu(y).
  \end{align*}
  Since $u(x) \geq s$ and $u(y) \geq s$, we must have $u(x) = u(y) = s$, meaning $x,y\in P_u$.
\end{example}
\section{The Krein--Milman Theorem}%
One of the most important results in extremal structure is the fact that every compact convex set of a topological vector space (with some relatively weak conditions) has an extreme point --- moreover, there are a lot of extreme points.
\begin{theorem}[Krein--Milman]
  Let $X$ be a topological vector space where $X^{\ast}$ separates points. If $K$ is a nonempty compact convex set in $X$, then
  \begin{align*}
    K &= \overline{\operatorname{conv}}\left( \operatorname{ext}\left( K \right) \right).
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We start with a lemma.
  \begin{lemma}
    If $F$ is a face of $K$ and $G$ is a face of $F$, then $G$ is a face of $K$.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $x,y\in K$ be such that for all $t\in (0,1)$, $\left( 1-t \right)x + ty\in G$. Then, since $G$ is a face of $F$, we have $\left( 1-t \right)x + ty \in F$, so since $F$ is a face, $x,y\in F$. However, since $G$ is a face, $x,y\in G$, so $G$ is a face of $K$.
  \end{proof}
  We start by showing that $\operatorname{ext}\left( K \right)\neq\emptyset$. Let $F\subseteq K$ be a closed face. The family
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{G} &= \set{G\subseteq F | G\text{ is a closed face in }F}
  \end{align*}
  is nonempty, as $F\in \mathcal{G}$. Ordering $\mathcal{G}$ by containment, we will show that $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies the conditions of Zorn's lemma. If $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathcal{G}$ is a chain, then we claim that
  \begin{align*}
    I &= \bigcap_{G\in \mathcal{C}} G
  \end{align*}
  is an element of $\mathcal{G}$ that is an upper bound for $\mathcal{C}$. First, since $I$ is an arbitrary intersection of convex sets, $I$ is convex.\newline

  Furthermore, for any $G_1,\dots,G_n\in \mathcal{C}$, then since $\mathcal{C}$ is a chain, there is $j$ such that $G_i\preceq G_j$ For all $i=1,\dots,n$, meaning $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}G_i = G_j\neq \emptyset$. Since $K$ is compact, the finite intersection property gives $I\neq\emptyset$. Finally, let $t\in (0,1)$ with $x,y\in F$ and $\left( 1-t \right)x + ty\in I$. Then, $\left( 1-t \right)x + ty\in G$ for all $G\in \mathcal{C}$, so $x,y\in G$ for all $G\in \mathcal{C}$, so $x,y\in I$, meaning $I$ is a face. Notice that for all $G\in \mathcal{C}$, we have $G\preceq I$, so the conditions of Zorn's lemma are satisfied.\newline

  By Zorn's lemma, there is a maximal $P\in \mathcal{G}$. We claim that $P$ is a singleton.\newline

  Note that $P$ is compact since it is closed. Let $\varphi\in X^{\ast}$ and set $u = \re\left( \varphi \right)$. Since $P$ is compact, the set
  \begin{align*}
    P_u &= \set{p\in P | u(p) = \inf_{x\in P}u(x)},
  \end{align*}
  and by maximality, we must have $P_u = P$. Since $\varphi(x)= u(x) -iu\left( ix \right)$ , we must have that $\varphi$ is constant on $P$, so $P = \set{z}$ as $X^{\ast}$ separates points. \newline

  Since $F$ is a face, and $P\subseteq F$ is a face, $P$ is a face, so $z\in \operatorname{ext}\left( K \right)$.\newline

  Now, note that $C = \overline{\operatorname{conv}}\left( \operatorname{ext}\left( K \right) \right)\subseteq K$ as $K$ is closed and convex. Suppose that this inclusion is strict. Let $x_0\in K\setminus C$.\newline

  Then, by the Hahn--Banach separation, there is $\varphi\in X^{\ast}$ such that for all $y\in C$,
  \begin{align*}
    u\left( x_0 \right) < t \leq u(y),
  \end{align*}
  where $u = \re\left( \varphi \right)$. Let $s = \inf_{k\in K}u(k)$, so that $K_u = \set{x\in K | u(x) = s}$. This is a closed face in $K$, so it has an extreme point $z\in K$, with $z\in C$. Then, $u(z) \geq t > s$, but $z\in K_u$, so $u(z) = s$. Therefore, the inclusion is not strict.
\end{proof}
