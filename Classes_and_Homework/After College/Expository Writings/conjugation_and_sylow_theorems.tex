\section{Introduction to Conjugation}%
Every transitive left-action of a group on a set $S$ is, up to isomorphism, left-multiplication on the set of left-cosets of $G/\stab_G(a)$, where $\stab_G(a)$ denotes the stabilizer subgroup of $a\in S$. Furthermore, the number of elements of a finite orbit of $a\in O_a$ is the index of $\Stab_G(a)$ --- this is the much celebrated \textit{orbit-stabilizer theorem}.\newline

Note that from the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we can partition $S$ into a formula involving the conjugacy classes. Since every element of $s$ is either in an orbit or is in the set
\begin{align*}
  Z\coloneq \set{a\in S | g\cdot a = a\text{ for all $g\in G$}},
\end{align*}
we calculate
\begin{align*}
  \left\vert S \right\vert &= \left\vert Z \right\vert + \sum_{a\in A} \left\vert O_a \right\vert\\
                           &= \left\vert Z \right\vert + \sum_{a\in A} \left[ G:\Stab_G(a) \right],
\end{align*}
where $A$ is a system of representatives for the orbits. This is \textsl{a} class formula for the action of $G$ on $S$.\newline

The power of this class formula is that when $G$ is finite, $\left[ G:\Stab_G(a) \right]$ always divides $G$, which is a very strong constraint when we know something about $\left\vert G \right\vert$.
\begin{proposition}
  Let $\left\vert G \right\vert = p^{n}$ be a group that acts on a finite set $S$, and let $Z$ be the set of fixed points for the action. Then, $\left\vert Z \right\vert\equiv \left\vert S \right\vert$ modulo $p$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Since each summand of the form $\left[ G:\Stab_G(a) \right]$ is a number larger than $1$ and a power of $p$, each $\left[ G:\Stab_G(a) \right]$ is congruent to $0$ mod $p$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}[Conjugation Action]
  Let $G$ be a group. The \textit{conjugation action} of $G$ on itself is defined by $\rho\colon G\times G \rightarrow G$, where
  \begin{align*}
    \rho\left( g,a \right) &= gag^{-1}.
  \end{align*}
  This map is equal to a particular group homomorphism $\sigma\colon G\rightarrow \sym(G)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Center]
  The \textit{center} of $G$, denoted $Z(G)$, is the subgroup $\ker\left( \sigma \right)\subseteq G$. Concretely, it is
  \begin{align*}
    Z(G)&= \set{g\in G | ga = ag\text{ for all $a\in G$}}.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
Note that $Z(G)$ is always a normal subgroup, and all elements of $Z(G)$ commute with each other. Furthermore, a group $G$ is abelian if and only if $Z(G) = G$.
\begin{lemma}
  Let $G$ be a finite group, and suppose $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Then, $G$ is commutative.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Write $Z\coloneq Z(G)$, and suppose $G/Z$ is cyclic. Then, there is some $g\in G$ such that $\left\langle gZ \right\rangle = G/Z$. For all $a\in G$, there is some integer $r$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    aZ &= g^{r}Z,
  \end{align*}
  meaning there exists some $z\in Z$ such that $a = g^{r}z$. Similarly, we write $b = g^{s}w$ for some $w\in Z$ and integer $s$. However, this means
  \begin{align*}
    ab &= \left( g^{r}z \right)\left( g^{s}w \right)\\
       &= g^{r+s}zw\\
       &= \left( g^{s}w \right)\left( g^{r}z \right)\\
       &= ba,
  \end{align*}
  where we use the fact that $z$ and $w$ commute with every element of $G$.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  Let $a\in G$. The \textit{centralizer} of $a$, denoted $Z_G(a)$, is the stabilizer of $a$ under conjugation. Concretely,
  \begin{align*}
    Z_G(a) &= \set{g\in G | ga = ag},
  \end{align*}
  or the set of elements of $G$ that commute with $a$.\newline

  Note that $Z(G)\subseteq Z_G(a)$ for all $a\in G$, and that
  \begin{align*}
    Z(G) &= \bigcap_{a\in G} Z_G(a).
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  The \textit{conjugacy class} of $a\in G$ is the orbit $\left[ a \right]$ of $a$ under conjugation.
\end{definition}
\section{The Class Equation}%
What we call \textsl{the} class equation is generally the class formula for conjugation.
\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a finite group. Then,
  \begin{align*}
    \left\vert G \right\vert &= \left\vert Z(G) \right\vert + \sum_{a\in A} \left[ G:Z_G(a) \right],
  \end{align*}
  where $A$ is a family of representatives of conjugacy classes in $G$. This is known as the \textit{class equation} for the group $G$.
\end{definition}
We are very easily able to apply the class equation to prove certain properties about $p$-groups.
\begin{proposition}
  Let $G$ be a nontrivial $p$-group. Then, $G$ has a nontrivial center.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\left\vert Z(G) \right\vert \equiv \left\vert G \right\vert$ modulo $p$, and $\left\vert G \right\vert > 1$ is a power of $p$, we have $\left\vert Z(G) \right\vert$ is a multiple of $p$. Since $e_G\in Z(G)$, we know that $\left\vert Z(G) \right\vert \geq p$.
\end{proof}
\begin{exercise}
  Let $p,q$ be prime numbers, and let $G$ be a group of order $pq$. Prove that either $G$ is commutative or the center of $G$ is trivial.\newline

  Conclude that every group of order $p^2$ is commutative.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  From the class equation, we know that
  \begin{align*}
    pq &= \left\vert Z(G) \right\vert + \sum_{a\in A} \left[ G:Z_G(a) \right].
  \end{align*}
  If $\left\vert Z(G) \right\vert  = pq$, then $G$ is abelian.\newline

  Suppose toward contradiction that, without loss of generality, $\left\vert Z(G) \right\vert = p$. Then, $\left\vert G/Z(G) \right\vert = q$, meaning $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, so $G$ is abelian, so $Z(G) = G$. $\bot$\newline

  Since, in any $p$-group, $\left\vert Z(G) \right\vert \geq p$, we must have that $Z(G) = G$, so $G$ is abelian.
\end{solution}
\begin{example}
  Let $G$ be a group of order $6$. What are the possibilities for its class formula?\newline

  In general, if $G$ is commutative, the class formula doesn't say much --- in this case, it says $6 = 6$.\newline

  If $G$ is not commutative then its center is trivial ($ 6 = 2\times 3 $), so we have $6 = 1 + \cdots$. Specifically, the $\cdots$ refers to the sizes of the conjugacy classes, which must be smaller than $6$, greater than $1$, and divide $6$. Thus, we have
  \begin{align*}
    6 &= 1 + 2 + 3
  \end{align*}
  as the only possible class equation for a noncommutative group with six elements.
\end{example}
Note that normal subgroups are unions of conjugacy classes.\footnote{This is used to show that $A_5$ is simple, for those of us studying for qualifiers.} If $H$ is a normal subgroup, and $a\in H$ with $b = gag^{-1}$ conjugate to $a$, we must have $b\in gHg^{-1} = H$.\newline

Furthermore, every subgroup must have the identity and its size must divide the order of the group; therefore, a noncommutative group of order $6$ cannot have any subgroup of order $2$, since $2$ cannot be written as a sum of orders of conjugacy classes including the center.
\begin{definition}
  Let $A\subseteq G$ be a subset, $g\in G$ an element. The \textit{conjugate} of $A$ is the subset $gAg^{-1}$; the map $a\mapsto gag^{-1}$ is a bijection between $A$ and $gAg^{-1}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Let $A\subseteq G$ be a subset. The \textit{normalizer} $N_G(A)$ is its stabilizer under conjugation. The \textit{centralizer} of $A$ is the subgroup $Z_G(A)\subseteq N_G(A)$ that fixes each element of $A$.
\end{definition}
Therefore, $g\in N_G(A)$ if and only if $gAg^{-1} = A$, and $g\in Z_G(A)$ if and only if $gag^{-1} = a$ for all $a\in A$. If $A = \set{a}$, then $N_G(A) = Z_G(A) = Z_G(a)$. However, in general, $Z_G(A)\subsetneq N_G(A)$.\newline

If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then every conjugate $gHg^{-1}$ of $H$ is also a subgroup of $G$; all conjugate subgroups have the same order.
\begin{lemma}
  Let $H\subseteq G$ be a group. Then, the number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ equals the index $\left[ G:N_G(H) \right]$ of the normalizer of $H$ in $G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Considering the group's self-action of conjugation, this follows from the orbit-stabilizer theorem.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  If $\left[ G:H \right]$ is finite, then the number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ is finite and divides $\left[ G:H \right]$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    \left[ G:H \right] &= \left[ G:N_G(H) \right]\left[ N_G(H):H \right].
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
A useful fact is that if $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$ such that $H\subseteq N_G(K)$ --- i.e., that $gKg^{-1} = K$ for all $g\in H$ --- then conjugation by $g\in H$ gives an automorphism of $K$. Thus, there is a set function
\begin{align*}
  \gamma\colon H\rightarrow \aut\left( K \right).
\end{align*}
\begin{exercise}
  Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of $G$ with $H\subseteq N_G(K)$. Verify that the function $\gamma\colon H\rightarrow \aut(K)$ defined by conjugation is a homomorphism of groups, and $\ker\left( \gamma \right) = H\cap Z_G(K)$, where $Z_G(K)$ is the centralizer of $K$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  Let $a,b\in H$. Then,
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma\left( ab^{-1} \right) &= \left( ab^{-1} \right) K \left( ab^{-1} \right)^{-1}\\
                                 &= ab^{-1} K ba^{-1}\\
                                 &= \left( aKa^{-1} \right) \left( b^{-1}Kb \right)\\
                                 &= \left( aKa^{-1} \right)\left( bKb^{-1} \right)^{-1}\\
                                 &= \gamma\left( a \right)\gamma\left( b \right)^{-1}.
  \end{align*}
  The kernel of $\gamma$ consists of all those elements of $H$ that map to $\id\colon K\rightarrow K$ --- i.e., those that map to the centralizer of $K$. Therefore, $\ker\left( \gamma \right)$ consists of $H\cap Z_G(K)$.
\end{solution}
\section{The Sylow Theorems}%
The Sylow Theorems are a collection of theorems that concern $p$-subgroups of a certain finite group $G$. The first of the theorems says that $G$ contains $p$-groups of all sizes allowed by Lagrange's theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Theorem]
  Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $p$ be a prime divisor of $\left\vert G \right\vert$. Then, $G$ contains an element of order $p$.
\end{theorem}
We can show the abelian case as an exercise.
\begin{exercise}
  Suppose $G$ is a finite abelian group, and let $p$ be a prime divisor of $\left\vert G \right\vert$. Prove there exists an element of order $p$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  Let $g\in G$. Then, $\left\langle g \right\rangle\subseteq G$ is a cyclic subgroup, meaning that it is of order $k$, where $k$ divides $\left\vert G \right\vert$. Assuming $k\geq 2$, we may write $k = p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_n^{e_n}$, where $p_i$ are prime. Then, for some prime $q $ such that $q$ divides $ k$, we may take the prime subgroup $\left\langle h \right\rangle \coloneq \left\langle g^{k/q} \right\rangle$.\newline

  Now, if $q = p$, we are done; else, we may take $G/\left\langle h \right\rangle$, which has order $\left\vert G \right\vert/q$, and since $p\neq q$, we may commence with the same process on $G/\left\langle h \right\rangle$.
\end{solution}
However, we can also show the general case.
\begin{proof}
  Let $S$ be the set of ordered $p$-tuples of elements of $G$, $\left( a_1,\dots,a_p \right)$, such that $a_1\cdots a_p = e$. Then, $\left\vert S \right\vert = \left\vert G \right\vert^{p-1}$, as we may choose $a_1,\dots,a_{p-1}$ arbitrarily, and select $a_p$ to be the inverse of $a_1\cdots a_{p-1}$.\newline

  Since $p$ divides the order of $S$, it divides the order of $G$. Note that if $a_1,\dots,a_p = e$, then
  \begin{align*}
    a_2\cdots a_pa_1 = e,
  \end{align*}
  as $a_1$ is a left-inverse to $a_2\cdots a_p$, so it is a right inverse. Therefore, we may act $\Z/p\Z$ on $S$ by taking $\left[ m \right]$ to act on $\left( a_1,\dots,a_p \right)$ yielding $\left( a_{m+1},\dots, a_p,a_1,\dots,a_m \right)$; this yields an element of $S$.\newline

  Thus, by the general class equation, we have $\left\vert Z \right\vert \equiv \left\vert S \right\vert \equiv 0$ modulo $p$, where $Z$ is the set of fixed points of the action.\newline

  In particular, fixed points are $p$-tuples of the form $\left( a,\dots,a \right)$; note that $Z\neq \emptyset$, since $\left( e,\dots,e \right)\in Z$. Thus, there is some element in $Z$ of the form $\left( a,\dots,a \right)$ with $a\neq e$.\newline

  In particular, this means there is $a\in G$ with $a\neq e$ and $a^p = e$.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  If $p$ is a prime divisor of $\left\vert G \right\vert$, and $N$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order $p$, then $N\equiv 1$ mod $p$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\left\vert Z \right\vert$ in the proof of Cauchy's theorem is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$, we must have $\left\vert Z \right\vert = mp$ for some $m \geq 1$. Now, since $e_G\in Z$ but $e_G$ is not of order $p$, we must have $mp - 1$ elements of order $p$ in $G$.\newline

  Since it takes $p-1$ elements of order $p$ to yield a cyclic subgroup of order $p$, we thus have $N = \frac{mp-1}{p-1}\equiv \frac{-1}{-1} = 1$ mod $p$.
\end{proof}
\begin{exercise}
  Let $G$ be a group. A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is called \textit{characteristic} if $\varphi\left( H \right) \subseteq H$ for all automorphisms $\varphi$ of $G$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Prove that characteristic subgroups are normal.
    \item Let $H\subseteq K \subseteq G$, with $H$ characteristic in $K$ and $K$ normal in $G$. Prove that $H$ is normal in $G$.
    \item Let $G,K$ be groups, and suppose $G$ contains a single subgroup $H$ isomorphic to $K$. Prove that $H$ is normal in $G$.
    \item Let $K$ be a normal subgroup of a finite  group $G$, and assume $\left\vert K \right\vert$ and $\left\vert G/K \right\vert$ are relatively prime. Prove that $K$ is characteristic in $G$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\hfill
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Since conjugation is an automorphism, we have $gHg^{-1}\subseteq H$ for each $g\in G$, meaning $H$ is normal.
    \item Since $K$ is normal in $G$, $K$ is preserved under conjugation by elements of $G$, so conjugation by elements of $G$ is an automorphism of $K$. Thus $H$ is preserved by conjugation of elements in $G$, so $H$ is normal in $G$.
    \item Let $\varphi\colon G\rightarrow K$ be a surjective homomorphism such that $\varphi(H)\cong K$. Then, 
      \begin{align*}
        \varphi\left( gHg^{-1} \right) &= \varphi\left( g \right)\varphi\left( H \right)\varphi\left( g \right)^{-1}\\
                                       &= K,
      \end{align*}
      so $gHg^{-1} = H$, meaning $H$ is normal.
    \item Let $\left\vert K \right\vert$ and $\left\vert G/K \right\vert$ be relatively prime.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

Using part (c) of the exercise, we can see that if there is only one cyclic subgroup $H$ of order $p$, then that subgroup must be normal.
\begin{definition}
  A group $G$ is called \textit{simple} if the only normal subgroups of $G$ are $\set{e}$ and $G$.
\end{definition}
