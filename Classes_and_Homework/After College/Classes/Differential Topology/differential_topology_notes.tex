\section{Basic Properties}%
\begin{definition}
  A topological space $M$ is called a \textit{manifold} if it satisfies the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is Hausdorff (points can be separated by open sets);
    \item $M$ is second countable (the basis for the topology of $M$ is countable);
    \item $M$ is locally Euclidean (every point in $M$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\R^n$ for some $n$).
  \end{itemize}
  In particular, the third condition says that for every $p\in M$, there is $U\in \mathcal{O}_p$ and a homeomorphism $\varphi\colon U\rightarrow \R^n$. The value of $n$ is called the \textit{dimension} of the manifold $M$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Let $M$ be an $n$-manifold. A \textit{chart} on $M$ is a pair $\left( U,\varphi \right)$ such that $U\subseteq M$ is open, $\varphi\colon U\rightarrow \R^n$ is a homeomorphism.\newline

  A family of charts $\mathcal{A} = \set{\left( U_i,\varphi_i \right)}_{i\in I}$ is known as an \textit{atlas} if
  \begin{align*}
    M &= \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
To understand the smooth structure of a manifold, we consider a point $p\in M$ and two charts $\left( U,\varphi_U \right)$ and $\left( V,\varphi_V \right)$ such that $p\in U$ and $p\in V$. The functions $\varphi_U\colon U\rightarrow \R^n$ and $\varphi_V\colon V\rightarrow \R^n$ are homeomorphism, meaning that $\varphi_V\circ\varphi_U^{-1}\colon \varphi_{U}\left( U\cap V \right)^n\rightarrow \R^n$ defined on the (nonempty) $U\cap V$ is also a homeomorphism.\newline

In particular, we develop the smooth structure by making sure all such pairs $\varphi_{V}\circ\varphi_U^{-1}$ are \textit{diffeomorphisms}. To do this, we need to first develop the derivative in $\R^n$.
\begin{definition}
  Let $f\colon \R^n\rightarrow \R^m$ be a function. We say $f$ is \textit{differentiable} at $p\in \R^n$ if there is a linear map $L\in \Hom\left( \R^n,\R^m \right)$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\norm{f\left( p+h \right)-f\left( p \right)-Lh}}{\norm{h}} &\rightarrow 0
  \end{align*}
  as $h\rightarrow 0$.\newline

  The \textit{derivative} of $f$ is the association $f\mapsto L$ for each $p\in \R^n$. We write $D_pf$ to denote this map. Note that we consider elements of $\Mat_{n}\left( \R \right)$ as points in $\R^{n^2}$ with the standard topology on $\R^{n^2}$.\newline

  A function $f$ is called a \textit{diffeomorphism} if it is continuously differentiable and has a continuously differentiable inverse.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  If $\left( U,\varphi_U \right)$ and $\left( V,\varphi_V \right)$ are charts such that $U\cap V \neq \emptyset$, the function $\varphi_{V}\circ \varphi_{U}^{-1}\colon \R^n\rightarrow \R^n$ is known as the \textit{transition map} between $\varphi_U$ and $\varphi_V$.\newline

  A smooth structure for $M$ is an atlas $\set{\left( U_i,\varphi_i \right)}_{i\in I}$ such that for all $i,j$, the transition maps $\varphi_j\circ \varphi_i^{-1}\colon \R^n\rightarrow \R^n$ are diffeomorphisms where defined.\newline

  If $\set{\left( U_i,\varphi_i \right)}_{i\in I}$ is a \textit{maximal} smooth atlas --- i.e., any other smooth atlas that contains $\set{\left( U_i,\varphi_i \right)}_{i\in I}$ is equal to $\set{\left( U_i,\varphi_i \right)}_{i\in I}$ --- then we call $\set{\left( U_i,\varphi_i \right)}_{i\in I}$ a \textit{smooth structure} for $M$.
\end{definition}
\begin{note}
  From now on, we use ``manifold'' to refer to smooth manifolds, and will say \textit{topological} manifolds if the manifold does not necessarily admit a smooth structure.
\end{note}
\begin{definition}
  A map $f\colon M\rightarrow N$ between manifolds is called \textit{smooth} if for any chart $\left( U,\varphi_U \right)$ in $M$ and corresponding chart $\left( V,\varphi_V \right)$ in $N$, the map $\varphi_V\circ f \circ \varphi_U^{-1}\colon \R^n\rightarrow \R^k$ is continuously differentiable.\newline

  The function $f$ is a \textit{diffeomorphism} if $f$ is a smooth bijection with smooth inverse, and we say the manifolds $M$ and $N$ are diffeomorphic if they admit a diffeomorphism.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Examples}%
There are a couple special examples of (smooth) manifolds.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Open subsets of $\R^n$ are always manifolds.
  \item The general linear group, $\GL_n\left( \R \right)$ of $n\times n$ invertible matrices, viewed as a subset of $\Mat_{n}\left( \R \right)\cong \R^{n^2}$, is a manifold. Furthermore, it is an open subset of $\R^{n^2}$, as considering the map $\det\colon \Mat_{n}\left( \R \right)\rightarrow \R$ given by $A\mapsto \det\left( A \right)$, we see that $\GL_{n}\left( \R \right) = \det^{-1}\left( \R\setminus \set{0} \right)$.
  \item The special linear group, $\SL_n\left( \R \right)\subseteq \GL_n\left( \R \right)$, consisting of $n\times n$ matrices with determinant $1$, is also a smooth manifold. Furthermore, this manifold is a closed subset of $\R^{n^2}$, as it is equal to $\det^{-1}\left( \set{1} \right)$.
  \item The $n$-sphere, $S^{n}$, given by
    \begin{align*}
      S^{n} = \set{\left( x_0,\dots,x_n \right) | \sum_{i=0}^{n}x_i^2 = 1}
    \end{align*}
    is a manifold in $\R^{n}$. That it is a smooth manifold is quite a bit less obvious.\newline

    Now, in low dimensions, we know that $S^{2} \cong \hat{\C} = \C\cup\set{\infty}$, and that the continuously differentiable transformation $z\mapsto \frac{1}{z}$ takes the neighborhood basis of $\infty$ to deleted neighborhoods of $0$, and takes the neighborhood basis of $0$ to the neighborhood basis of $\infty$. This is our desired smooth structure.\newline

    In the case of the general $S^{n}$, we use two stereographic projections to construct our smooth structure. The first stereographic projection is via the north pole, $N_{p}$, and maps points on $S^{n}\setminus \set{N_{p}}$ bijectively to $\R^{n}$; this is a chart that is defined everywhere on $S^{n}$ except $N_{p}$. Similarly, we may use a stereographic projection originating from the south pole, $S_{p}$, so as to create another chart defined everywhere except $S_{p}$. These two stereographic projections are our desired smooth structure, as these two charts are all that is necessary to cover $S^{n}$.
  \item The real projective plane, consisting of lines through the origin in $\R^{n+1}$, can be expressed as
    \begin{align*}
      \R\mathbb{P}^{n} &= \left( \R^{n+1}\setminus \set{0} \right)/\R^{\times}.
    \end{align*}
    We will show that this is a manifold by constructing a family of charts mapping to $\R^{n}$.\newline

    Consider a point $\left( r_0,\dots,r_n \right)\in \R^{n+1}\setminus \set{0}$. If $r_0\neq 0$, then by dividing, we may associate this point's equivalence class in $\R\mathbb{P}^{n}$ to
    \begin{align*}
      \left( 1,r_1/r_0,\dots,r_n/r_0 \right) &\in \set{1}\times \R^{n},
    \end{align*}
    so we may associate all points of the form $\left[ \left( r_0,\dots,r_n \right) \right]$ with $r_0\neq 0$ with a chart $\left( U_{0},\varphi_{0} \right)$ that maps $\R\mathbb{P}^{n}$ to $\R^{n}$.\newline

    Similarly, we may define $U_{k}$ via
    \begin{align*}
      U_{k} &= \set{\left[ \left( r_0,\dots,r_n \right) \right] | r_k\neq 0}
    \end{align*}
    with corresponding chart
    \begin{align*}
      \varphi_{k}\colon U_{k}&\rightarrow \R^{n}\\
      \left[ \left( r_0,\dots,r_n \right) \right] &\mapsto \frac{1}{r_{k}} \left( r_0,\dots,\widehat{r_k},\dots,r_n \right),
    \end{align*}
    where $\widehat{r_k}$ denotes the exclusion of the $r_k$ coordinate. Varying $k$ from $0$ to $n$, we see that
    \begin{align*}
      \R\mathbb{P}^{n} &= \bigcup_{k=0}^{n}U_k,
    \end{align*}
    the chart functions $\varphi_{k}\colon U_k\rightarrow \R^{n}$ are homeomorphisms (as they are just division and projections). Furthermore, the transition maps $\varphi_{j}\circ\varphi_{i}^{-1}$ are coordinate-wise rational functions defined by
    \begin{align*}
      \left( u_1,\dots,u_n \right) &\mapsto \left( \frac{u_1}{u_i},\dots,\frac{1}{u_i},\dots,\frac{u_n}{u_i} \right),
    \end{align*}
    where the $\frac{1}{u_i}$ is at position $j$.
  \item We now turn to a very important example from algebraic geometry: the Grassmannian, $\operatorname{Gr}\left( k,n \right)$, consisting of all the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\R^{n}$.\newline

    This is a $k\left( n-k \right)$-dimensional manifold; we need to understand what the smooth structure is. To do this, we let $ \iprod{\cdot}{\cdot} $ be an inner product on $\R^{n}$, and for any $V\in \operatorname{Gr}\left( k,n \right)$, we consider maps in $\Hom\left( V,V^{\perp} \right)$, where $V^{\perp}$ denotes the orthogonal complement of $V$.\newline

    Now, we see that if $W\in \operatorname{Gr}\left( k,n \right)$ is any other $k$-dimensional subspace, the orthogonal $P_{V}\colon \R^{n}\rightarrow V$ restricted to $W$ is a linear isomorphism if and only if $W\nsubseteq V^{\perp}$, or that $W\cap V^{\perp} = \set{0}$.\newline

    We see that if $W$ is such that $P_{V}|_{W}\colon W\rightarrow V$ is a linear isomorphism, the inverse $\left( P_{V}|_{W} \right)^{-1}\colon V\rightarrow W$ is well-defined; so, we may make a correspondence between $\Hom\left( V,V^{\perp} \right)$ and $\operatorname{Gr}\left( k,n \right)$ by noting that any such $T\in \Hom\left( V,V^{\perp} \right)$ has a corresponding graph $\left( v,T(v) \right)$, so we take $v\mapsto P_{V}|_{W}^{-1}\left( v \right)$, then project onto $V^{\perp}$ by taking $T\left( P_{V^{\perp}}\left( P_{V}|_{W}^{-1}(v) \right) \right) = T(v)$. We depict it as a diagram below.

      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    Defining $U_{V} = \set{W\in \operatorname{Gr}\left( k,n \right) | W\cap V^{\perp} = \set{0}}$, we may define the chart from $U_{V}$ onto $\Hom\left( V,V^{\perp} \right)$ by $\varphi_{V} = P_{V^{\perp}}\circ P_{V}|_{W}^{-1}$. The family $\set{\left( U_V,\varphi_V \right) | V\in \operatorname{Gr}\left( k,n \right)}$ is our smooth atlas.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inverse and Implicit Function Theorems}%
In order to replace manifolds with linear maps, we need to understand smooth maps on $\R^n$. The most important theorems in this regard are the inverse function theorem and the implicit function theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Inverse Function Theorem]
  Let $f\colon U\subseteq \R^n \rightarrow \R^n$ be a continuously differentiable function. If $D_{p}f$ is invertible as a linear map, then $f$ has a local, continuously differentiable inverse $f^{-1}\colon V\rightarrow W$, where $p\in W\subseteq U$ and $f(p)\in V\subseteq \R^n$.
\end{theorem}
The proof uses the contraction mapping theorem. Recall that if $X$ is a complete metric space, and $f\colon X\rightarrow X$ is a strict uniform contraction --- that is, there exists $0\leq \lambda < 1$ such that $d\left( f(x),f(y) \right) \leq \lambda d\left( x,y \right)$ for all $x,y\in X$ --- then $f$ has a unique fixed point.\newline

We begin with a technical lemma.
\begin{lemma}
  If $U\left( 0,r \right)\subseteq V$ for some $r > 0$ where $V$ is a normed vector space, $g\colon V\rightarrow V$ is a uniform contraction, and $f = \id + g$, then the following hold:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\left( 1-\lambda \right) \norm{x-y}\leq \norm{f(x)-f(y)}$ (in particular, $f$ is injective);
    \item if $g(0) = 0$, then
      \begin{align*}
        U\left( 0,\left( 1-\lambda \right)r \right) \subseteq f\left( U\left( 0,r \right) \right) \subseteq U\left( 0,\left( 1+\lambda \right)r \right).
      \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma]
  To see the first item, we notice that by the triangle inequality,
  \begin{align*}
    \norm{x-y} - \norm{f(x)-f(y)} &\leq \norm{x-y} - \norm{x-y} + \norm{g(x)-g(y)}\\
                                  &\leq \lambda\norm{x-y},
  \end{align*}
  so $\left( 1-\lambda \right)\norm{x-y}\leq \norm{f(x)-f(y)}$, and $f$ is injective. Furthermore, we see that if $g(0) = 0$, then
  \begin{align*}
    f\left( U\left( 0,r \right) \right) &= U\left( 0,r \right) + g\left( U\left( 0,r \right) \right)\\
                                        &\subseteq U\left( 0,r \right) + \lambda U\left( 0,r \right)\\
                                        &= U\left( 0,\left( 1+\lambda \right)r \right).
  \end{align*}
  Finally, if $y\in U\left( 0,\left( 1-\lambda \right)r \right)$, then we want to find $x$ such that $y = f(x) = x + g(x)$; equivalently, we see that we want $x$ such that $x = y-g(x)$. Since the function $F(x) = y-g(x)$ is a translation of a uniform contraction, $F(x)$ is a contraction, so there is a fixed point, meaning $y\in f\left( U\left( 0,r \right) \right)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{note}
  We will use $\left\vert \cdot \right\vert$ to denote the norm on $\R^n$.
\end{note}
\begin{proof}[Proof of the Inverse Function Theorem]
  By using a series of affine maps --- first by translating $p$ to $0$, then translating $f(p)$ to $0$, then inverting $D_0f$ as per our assumption, we may safely assume that $p = f(p) =0$ and $D_0f = \operatorname{Id}$.\newline

  Set $g = f - \operatorname{Id}$. We will show that $g$ is a contraction in a sufficiently small ball. Fixing $x,y\in \R^n$, consider the map $\R\rightarrow \R^n$ given by $t \mapsto g\left( x + t\left( y-x \right) \right)$. Notice that by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
  \begin{align*}
    \left\vert g(y)-g(x) \right\vert &\leq \left\vert y-x \right\vert \sup_{0\leq t \leq 1} \left\vert g'\left( x + t\left( y-x \right) \right) \right\vert.
  \end{align*}
  Furthermore, since $g'(0) = \mathbf{0}$ by the fact that $D_0f = \operatorname{Id}$ and $\left( \operatorname{Id} \right)' = \operatorname{Id}$, and since $f$ is continuously differentiable, there is $r > 0$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \left\vert g(y)-g(x) \right\vert &\leq \frac{1}{2}\left\vert y-x \right\vert
  \end{align*}
  for all $x,y\in U\left( 0,r \right)$. Thus, $g$ is a strict contraction on $U\left( 0,r \right)$. By the previous lemma, we see that
  \begin{align*}
    U\left( 0,r/2 \right) &\subseteq f\left( U\left( 0,r \right) \right);
  \end{align*}
  by setting $U = U\left( 0,r \right) \cap f^{-1}\left( U\left( 0,r \right) \right)$, we see that the map $f|_{U}\colon U\rightarrow V \coloneq U\left( 0,r/2 \right)$ is a bijection. The inverse function $f^{-1}\colon V\rightarrow U$ thus exists.\newline

  Now, we let $h = f^{-1}$, $x\in U$, $y\in V$ such that $h(x) = y$, and $A = D_xf$. We will show that $A^{-1} = D_yh$, which is enough to show that $h$ is continuously differentiable, as we assume the map $x \mapsto D_xf$ is continuous, and inversion is continuous in $\GL_n\left(\R\right)$.\newline

  For sufficiently small vectors $s$ and $k$, since $f$ and $h$ are bijections, we have
  \begin{align*}
    h\left( y+k \right) = x+s,
  \end{align*}
  so
  \begin{align*}
    f\left( x+s \right)  &= y+k.
  \end{align*}
  Furthermore, by unraveling the definitions of $f = g + \operatorname{Id}$, $s$, and $k$, and the fact that $g$ is a uniform contraction on $U$, we get
  \begin{align*}
    \left\vert s-k \right\vert &= \left\vert \left( f(x+s) - f(x) \right) - s \right\vert\\
                               &= \left\vert \left( x+s + g(x+s) \right) - \left( x + g(x) \right) -s\right\vert\\
                               &= \left\vert g(x+s) - g(x) \right\vert\\
                               &\leq \frac{\left\vert s \right\vert}{2}.
  \end{align*}
  In particular, since
  \begin{align*}
    \left\vert s \right\vert &\leq \left\vert s-k \right\vert + \left\vert k \right\vert\\
                             &\leq \left\vert k \right\vert + \frac{\left\vert s \right\vert}{2},
  \end{align*}
  we see that $\left\vert s \right\vert/2 \leq \left\vert k \right\vert$. We calculate
  \begin{align*}
    \left\vert h\left( y+k \right)-h\left( y \right) - A^{-1}k \right\vert &= \left\vert x+s-x-A^{-1}\left( f\left( x+s \right)-f(x) \right) \right\vert\\
                                                                           &= \left\vert s - A^{-1}\left( f\left( x+s \right)-f\left( x \right) \right) \right\vert\\
                                                                           &\leq \norm{A^{-1}}_{\op} \left\vert As - f\left( x+s \right) - f\left( x \right) \right\vert.
  \end{align*}
  Thus, since $\left\vert s \right\vert/2 \leq \left\vert k \right\vert$,
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\left\vert h\left( y+k \right)-h\left( y \right) - A^{-1}k \right\vert}{\left\vert k \right\vert} &\leq \frac{2\norm{A^{-1}}_{\op}\left\vert As-f\left( x+s \right)-f\left( x \right) \right\vert}{\left\vert s \right\vert}\\
                                                                                                            &\rightarrow 0,
  \end{align*}
  so $D_yh = A^{-1}$.
\end{proof}
