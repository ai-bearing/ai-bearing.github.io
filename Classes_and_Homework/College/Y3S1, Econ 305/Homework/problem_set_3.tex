  \begin{problem}{Strategies}
    Imagine an extensive-form game in which player $i$ has $K$ information sets.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      \item If the player has an identical number $m$ possible actions in each information set, how many pure strategies do they have?
      \item If the player has $m_k$ actions in information set $k\in \{1,2,\dots,K\}$, how many pure strategies does the player have?
    \end{enumerate}
    \tcblower
    \begin{problem}{(a)}
      The player has $mK$ strategies.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}{(b)}
      The player has $\prod_{k=1}^{k}m_k$ pure strategies.

  \begin{problem}{The Shipping News}
    Consider the following extensive form games. In both games, UPS ($U$) has to decide whether to Enter ($E$) or stay out ($O$) of a foreign market where DHL ($D$) is already active. If UPS enters the market, then both firms have to decide whether or not to start a price war by fighting $(F,F^*,f)$ or acquiescing $(A,A^*,a)$ to the entry. The payoffs list that of UPS first, followed by the payoff to DHL.

      In the first game, UPS only makes its decision to acquiesce or fight after DHL does, but in the second game, UPS and DHL make their decision simultaneously.

    \begin{problem}{(b)}
      Write the normal form of both games and find all of the pure strategy Nash equilibria in each game.

      Find all subgame perfect equilibria of both games.
