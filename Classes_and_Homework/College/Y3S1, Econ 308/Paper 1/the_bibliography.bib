	abstract = {Does America face an affordable housing crisis and, if so, why? This paper argues that in much of America the price of housing is quite close to the marginal, physical costs of new construction. The price of housing is significantly higher than construction costs only in a limited number of areas, such as California and some eastern cities. In those areas, we argue that high prices have little to do with conventional models with a free market for land. Instead, our evidence suggests that zoning and other land use controls, play the dominant role in making housing expensive.},

	abstract = {Housing supply elasticities can help explain why house prices differ across locations. This column uses a rich dataset and a novel identification method to show that {US} housing supply has become less elastic since the Global Crisis, with bigger declines in places where land-use regulation has tightened most and in areas that had larger price declines during the crisis. This new lower elasticity means {US} house prices should be more sensitive to changes in demand than before the crisis.},
