\section{Introduction}%
Oh hey, it's another one of these independent studies. Me and a friend are going to be going through William Fulton's \textit{Algebraic Curves}. It will be hard, it will be long, and it might not work out for me, but who cares.

\subsection{Algebraic Preliminaries}%
We will assume all rings are commutative with unity, where $\Z$ is the integers, $\Q$ is the rationals, $\R$ is the reals, and $\C$ is the complex numbers.\newline

Any integral domain $R$ has a quotient field $K$, which contains $R$ as a subring, and any element in $K$ may be written as a not necessarily unique ratio of two elements of $R$. Any one-to-one ring homomorphism from $R$ to a field $L$ extends uniquely to a ring homomorphism from $K$ to $L$.\newline

If $R$ is a ring, then $R[x]$ is the ring of polynomials with coefficients in $R$. The degree of a nonzero polynomial $\sum a_ix^i$ is the largest integer $d$ such that $a_d\neq 0$. The polynomial is monic if $a_d = 1$.\newline

The ring of polynomials in $n$ variables over $R$ is $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$. We write $R\left[x,y\right]$ and $R\left[x,y,z\right]$ if $n=2$ and $3$ respectively. Monomials in $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ are of the form $x^{(i)} \coloneq x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}$, where $i_j$ are nonnegative integers, and the degree of the monomial is $i_1 + \cdots i_n$. Every $F\in R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ has a unique expression $F = \sum a_{(i)}x^{(i)}$, where $x^{(i)}$ are monomials, and $a_{(i)}\in R$. We say $F$ is homogeneous of degree $d$ if all $a_{(i)}$ are zero except for monomials of degree $d$. The polynomial $F$ is written as $F = F_0 + F_1 + \cdots F_d$, where $F_i$ is a form of degree $i$, and $d = \deg(F)$ for $F_d\neq 0$.\newline

The ring $R$ is a subring of $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$, and the ring $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ is characterized by the following: if $\varphi\colon R\rightarrow S$ is a ring homomorphism, and $s_1,\dots,x_n$ are elements in $S$, then there is a unique extension of $\varphi$ to a ring homomorphism $\overline{\varphi}\colon R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]\rightarrow S$ such that $\overline{\varphi}\left(x_i\right) = s_i$. The image of $F$ under $\overline{\varphi}$ is written $F\left(s_1,\dots,s_n\right)$. The ring $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ is canonically isomorphic to $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\right]\left[x_n\right]$.\newline

An element $a\in R$ is called irreducible if it is not a unit or zero, and any factorization $a=bc$ with $b,c\in R$ is such that either $b $ or $c$ is a unit. A domain $R$ is a unique factorization domain (UFD) if every nonzero element in $R$ can be factored uniquely up to units and ordering.\newline

If $R$ is a UFD with quotient field $K$, then any irreducible element $F\in R[x]$ remains irreducible when considered in $K[x]$.
\begin{theorem}[Gauss's Lemma for $\Z$]
  If $F\in \Z[x]$ is a monic polynomial that is irreducible, then $F$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.
\end{theorem}
If $F$ and $G$ are polynomials in $R[x]$ with no common factors in $R[x]$, then they have no common factors in $K[x]$.\newline

If $R$ is a UFD, then $R[x]$ is also a UFD, and consequently $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ is a UFD for any field $k$. The quotient field of $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ is written $k\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)$ is called the field of rational functions in $n$ variables over $k$.\newline

If $\varphi\colon R\rightarrow S$ is a ring homomorphism, $\ker\left(\varphi\right)\coloneq \varphi^{-1}(0)$. The kernel is an ideal in $R$. An ideal in $R$ is proper if $I\neq R$, and a proper ideal is known as maximal if it is not contained in any larger proper ideal.\footnote{Alternatively, an ideal $I$ is maximal if the quotient ring $R/M$ is a field.} An ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime if, whenever $ab\in \mathfrak{p}$, then $a\in \mathfrak{p}$ or $b\in \mathfrak{p}$.\footnote{Alternatively, an ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime if $R/\mathfrak{p}$ is an integral domain.}\newline

Let $k$ be a field and $I$ a proper ideal in $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$. The canonical homomorphism $\pi$ from $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ to $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]/I$ restricts to a ring homomorphism from $k$ to $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]/I$. We regard $k$ as a subring of $k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]/I$, which is a vector space over $k$.\newline

If $R$ is an integral domain, then $\operatorname{char}\left(R\right)$, the characteristic of $R$, is the smallest integer $p$ such that 
\begin{align*}
  \underbrace{1+1\cdots +1}_{p\text{ times}} = 0. 
\end{align*}
If $p$ exists, we say $\operatorname{char}\left(R\right) = p$, else $0$.\newline

Note that if $\varphi\colon \Z\rightarrow R$ is the unique ring homomorphism from $\Z$ to $R$,\footnote{This is because $\Z$ is initial in the category of rings. See Aluffi.} then $\ker\left(\varphi\right) = \left\langle p \right\rangle$, so $\operatorname{char}\left(R\right)$ is prime or $0$.\newline

If $R$ is a ring, and $F\in R\left[x\right]$, and $a$ is a root of $F$, then $F = \left(x-a\right)G$ for some unique polynomial $G\in R[x]$. A field $k$ is algebraically closed if any nonconstant $F\in k\left[x\right]$ has a root.
\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.1]
Let $R$ be an integral domain.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item If $F$ and $G$ are forms of degree $r$ and $s$ respectively in $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$, show that $FG$ is a form of degree $r+s$.
  \item Show that any factor of a form in $R\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$ is also a form.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.2]
  Let $R$ be a UFD and $K$ the quotient field of $R$. Show that every element $z\in K$ may be written as $z = a/b$, where $a,b\in R$ have no common factors. This representative is unique up to units of $R$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.3]
  Let $R$ be a principal ideal domain, and let $P$ be a nonzero proper prime ideal in $R$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Show that $P$ is generated by an irreducible element.
    \item Show that $P$ is maximal.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\hfill
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Since $P$ is principal, we know that $ P = \left\langle a \right\rangle $ for some $a\in R$. We know that $a$ cannot be a unit, as otherwise $P = R$, contradicting the assumption that $P$ is proper, and that $a\neq 0$ as $P$ is not zero.\newline

      Suppose toward contradiction that $\left\langle a \right\rangle\subsetneq \left\langle b \right\rangle$ for some $b\in R$. Then, $a = bc$ for some $c\in R$. If $c\notin \left\langle a \right\rangle$, then since $\left\langle a \right\rangle$ is prime, we must have $b\in \left\langle a \right\rangle$, contradicting strict inclusion. Thus, $c\in \left\langle a \right\rangle$, so $c = at$ for some $t\in R$. Therefore, we have $a = abt$, so $bt = 1_R$, and $\left\langle b \right\rangle = R$.
    \item Since $R$ is a PID, and $P$ is prime, we know that $P = \left\langle a \right\rangle$ is generated by an irreducible element. Thus, if $\left\langle a \right\rangle\subseteq \left\langle b \right\rangle$, then $a = bc$ for some $c\in R$. Since we have unique factorization (as all PIDs are UFDs), and $a$ is irreducible, this means either $b$ or $c$ is a unit. If $b$ is a unit, then $\left\langle b  \right\rangle = R$, and if $c$ is a unit, then $\left\langle b \right\rangle = \left\langle a \right\rangle$. Thus, $\left\langle a \right\rangle$ is maximal.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.4]
Let $k$ be an infinite field, $f\in k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$. Suppose $F\left(a_1,\dots,a_n\right) = 0$ for all $a_1,\dots,a_n\in k$. Show that $f = 0$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.5]
Let $k$ be any field. Show that there are an infinite number of irreducible monic polynomials in $k\left[x\right]$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  Suppose $F_1,\dots,F_n$ were all the irreducible monic polynomials in $k\left[x\right]$. Consider the polynomial $P = F_1F_2\cdots F_n + 1$. We note that $P$ is monic. We will show that $P$ is irreducible.\newline

  Suppose toward contradiction that $P$ were reducible. We know that $k\left[x\right]$ is a principal ideal domain, so $P\in \left\langle F_i \right\rangle$ for some irreducible monic $F_i$. However, we know that, for any $F_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$, $P \nmid F_i$, as, applying the division algorithm to $P$, we get
  \begin{align*}
    P &= \left(F_i\right)\prod_{j\neq i}F_j + 1,
  \end{align*}
  where $r \neq 0$. Thus, $P$ is not reducible and monic, so there are infinitely many irreducible monic polynomials in $k\left[x\right]$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.6]
Show that any algebraically closed field is infinite.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  Note that if $k$ is any field, then there are infinitely many irreducible monic polynoimals in $k\left[x\right]$. If $k$ is algebraically closed, then $\left(x-a\right)$, for $a\in k$, is the only irreducible monic polynomial. Since there are infinitely many irreducible monic polynomials in $k\left[x\right]$, there are infinitely many $a\in k$ such that $\left(x-a\right)$ is irreducible in $k\left[x\right]$. Thus, $k$ is infinite.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}[Exercise 1.7]
Let $k$ be any field, and $F\in k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$, with $a_1,\dots,a_n\in k$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Show that
    \begin{align*}
      F &= \sum\lambda_{(i)}\left(x_1-a_1\right)^{i_1}\cdots \left(x_n-a_n\right)^{i_n},
    \end{align*}
    where $\lambda_{(i)}\in k$.
  \item If $F\left(a_1,\dots,a_n\right) = 0$, show that $F = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_i - a_i\right)G_i$ for some not necessarily unique $G_i\in k\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
