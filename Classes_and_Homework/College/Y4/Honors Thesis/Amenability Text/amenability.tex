\chapter{Introduction}
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth,\footnote{Well, maybe not God specifically.} and a lot of other things that are detailed in the book of Genesis. Unfortunately, those that wrote down and translated the book of Genesis failed to mention the most important feature of the universe that He (may or may not have) created --- the axiom of choice. It may be remarked that the axiom of choice is not, strictly speaking, a God-given creation, but accepting it certainly requires a leap of faith --- after all, Paul Cohen and Kurt Gödel showed that it is independent of the rest of the axioms of set theory --- but since we are going to be working in the realm of analysis throughout this thesis, we will be accepting it as such.\newline

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, and the convenient results that the axiom of choice provides for (see Example \ref{ex:results_follow_from_axiom_of_choice}), the axiom of choice provides some counterintuitive and downright paradoxical results --- not that it's worth throwing out, but it is certainly worth investigating and understanding. One of these counterintuitive results is detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:paradoxical_decompositions}, where we show implicitly that there does not exist a finitely additive measure on the three-dimensional real numbers that is also invariant under Euclidean isometry by proving the Banach--Tarski paradox in its most general form.\newline

Using the Banach--Tarski paradox as motivation, we then go to proving various characterizations, definitions, and proofs of amenability in groups --- i.e., we now want to understand when a group is well-behaved, rather than ill-behaved as in the case of the isometry group of $\R^3$. We first use some primarily group-theoretic techniques surrounding amenability, such as in the proof of Tarski's theorem in Chapter \ref{ch:tarskis_theorem} and the establishment of amenability in subgroups and quotient groups in the first section of Chapter \ref{ch:invariant_states}. Then, we use techniques from functional analysis in later chapters to prove amenability, first by establishing the equivalence between amenability and the existence of an invariant state on $\ell_{\infty}(G)$, in sections 2--4 of Chapter \ref{ch:invariant_states}; we then expand on these techniques in Chapter \ref{ch:folner_condition} to understand Følner's condition and approximate means.\newline

After a quick discussion of the application of Følner's condition to geometric group theory, we discuss representations of groups as bounded operators on Hilbert spaces, using yet more techniques from functional analysis and the theory of operator algebras to show, in Chapter \ref{ch:left_regular_representation}, that a group is amenable if it satisfies certain criteria related to the left-regular representation of $\Gamma$ on the space $\ell_2\left(\Gamma\right)$. Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:nuclearity}, we move from the representation of a group to representations of its group $\ast$-algebra, and show how properties of the group $C^{\ast}$-algebra inform us about properties of the group, and vice-versa.\newline

This is a very, very ambitious project that I am not sure I would have been able to complete without the effort that professor Rainone helped with understanding some of the more heavy theory surrounding amenability, the Følner condition, and especially $C^{\ast}$-algebras. Additionally, his draft Functional Analysis textbook was an incredibly helpful resource in learning everything necessary to understand the more heavy analysis-based formulations of amenability. Of course, in addition to his help, I'm grateful for the opportunities, classes, and memorable times I have spent with the mathematics department at Occidental, without whom I would never have believed myself capable of learning such intricate and complex topics.\newline

I have always believed that a proper thesis, even an expository one, need not be a bland affair. When it is a topic the author is especially interested in, such as myself with the concepts, theories, and ideas surrounding amenability, I believe it is of paramount importance that the author make the subject as enjoyable for the reader as it is for them. As a result, I have included light humor throughout this thesis, with the purpose of bringing a smile to the readers' face just as this topic has brought many a smile to my own.\newline

Most of the results and proofs in this thesis are not my own, but a compilation of various sources that I believe provide a broad and deep coverage of the subject; I have collected, simplified, and reordered them in order to understand not only for myself, but to potentially help others with the process of understanding amenability. Just because I may have forgotten to attribute them in the paper does not mean they are of my creation.\newline

Note that most of the groups in this thesis are countable, and all are endowed with the discrete topology. This is because if I dedicated the necessary time towards understanding and including the case of topological groups with any locally compact topology, this thesis would actually be longer than the Bible. Nonetheless, the case of countable discrete groups still provides very interesting case studies that strike at the heart of the foundations of mathematics.
