\section{Overview}%
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth,\footnote{Well, maybe not God specifically.} and a lot of other things that are detailed in the book of Genesis. Unfortunately, those that wrote down and translated the book of Genesis failed to mention the most important feature of the universe that He (may or may not have) created --- the axiom of choice. It may be remarked that the axiom of choice is not, strictly speaking, a God-given creation, but accepting it certainly requires a leap of faith --- after all, Paul Cohen and Kurt Gödel showed that it is independent of the rest of the axioms of set theory --- but since we are going to be working in the realm of analysis throughout this thesis, we will be accepting it as such.\newline

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, and the convenient results that the axiom of choice provides for (see Example \ref{ex:results_follow_from_axiom_of_choice}), the axiom of choice provides some counterintuitive and downright paradoxical results --- not that it's worth throwing out, but it is certainly worth investigating and understanding. One of these counterintuitive results is detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:paradoxical_decompositions}, where we show implicitly that there does not exist a finitely additive measure on the three-dimensional real numbers that is also invariant under Euclidean isometry by proving the Banach--Tarski paradox in its most general form.\newline

Using the Banach--Tarski paradox as motivation, we then go to proving various characterizations, definitions, and proofs of amenability in groups --- i.e., we now want to understand when a group is well-behaved, rather than ill-behaved as in the case of the isometry group of $\R^3$. We first use some primarily group-theoretic techniques surrounding amenability, such as in the proof of Tarski's theorem in Chapter \ref{ch:tarskis_theorem} and the establishment of amenability in subgroups and quotient groups in the first section of Chapter \ref{ch:invariant_states}. We then use techniques from functional analysis to prove amenability, first by establishing the equivalence between amenability and the existence of an invariant state on $\ell_{\infty}(G)$, in sections 2--4 of Chapter \ref{ch:invariant_states}; we then expand on these techniques in Chapter \ref{ch:folner_condition} to understand Følner's condition and approximate means.\newline

After a quick discussion of the application of Følner's condition to geometric group theory, we discuss representations of groups as bounded operators on Hilbert spaces, using yet more techniques from functional analysis and the theory of operator algebras to show, in Chapter \ref{ch:left_regular_representation}, that a group is amenable if it satisfies certain criteria related to the left-regular representation of $\Gamma$ on the space $\ell_2\left(\Gamma\right)$. Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:nuclearity}, we move from the representation of a group to representations of its group $\ast$-algebra, and show how properties of the group $C^{\ast}$-algebra inform us about properties of the group, and vice-versa.\newline

All vector spaces in this thesis are assumed to be over $\C$ unless otherwise specified, $0\in\N$, all groups are endowed with the discrete topology, and unless it is apparent otherwise, should be assumed countable and finitely generated. Nonetheless, even with this relatively limited scope, we can still establish some crucial results that provide a worthy harmonization of algebra and analysis.
\section{Apologies and Acknowledgments}%
As is evident from the file size or anyone who has a PDF viewer that reports the number of pages of a document, this thesis is certainly much, much longer than an undergraduate honors thesis generally is. Part of this is my fault --- I am more verbose and particular about spacing than the average mathematics writer --- and part of this is because the content was extremely fun to learn, and I just kept learning about it.\newline

This project's topic was originally conceived by professor Rainone in a footnote to one of the problems in problem set 8 of Real Analysis II in Spring 2024. The problem mentioned the idea of an amenable group and a paradoxical group, and had us prove the easy direction of Tarski's Theorem (Theorem \ref{thm:tarski}), with the footnote saying that the previous direction was a suitable honors project. After much hemming and hawing by yours truly, an appendix in the book \textit{Crossed Products of $C^{\ast}$-Algebras} by Dana Williams eventually convinced me that amenability was a topic worth exploring and understanding. It was a very good idea.\newline

Furthermore, as I dove deeper into the functional analysis necessary to understand the more heavy results in amenability, professor Rainone's draft textbook, \textit{Functional Analysis-En Route to Operator Algebras} was an incredible resource that helped me really understand the fundamentals of a subject that I had long desired to learn, but where most of the books were quite terse and hard to follow. I hope the text gets published sometime in the future, it is an extremely valuable resource.\newline

I have always believed that an expository text in mathematics need not be a bland affair. When it is a topic that the author is interested in, such as myself with the concepts, theories, and ideas surrounding amenability, I believe it is of paramount importance that the author make the subject as enjoyable for the reader as it is for them. Thus, I have included light humor throughout this thesis, hopefully without interfering with the substance of the mathematical content, with the purpose of bringing a smile to the readers' face just as this topic has brought many a smile to mine.\newline

The results and proofs in this thesis are primarily not my own, but a compilation of various sources that provide a broad and deep coverage of the subject. I have collected, simplified, exposited, and reordered them in order to understand not only for myself, but to potentially help others with the process of understanding amenability. I have attempted my best to attribute all theorems and proofs to the texts that I have obtained them from --- just because I may have forgotten to attribute a proof to someone does not mean it is my own (indeed, it is probably not).
%The groups in this thesis should be assumed countable and finitely generated unless it is otherwise clear that they are not (such as $\text{SO}\left( 3 \right)$, which is obviously not countable or finitely generated), and all are endowed with the discrete topology. This is because if I dedicated the necessary time towards understanding and including the case of topological groups with any locally compact topology, this thesis would actually be longer than the Bible. Nonetheless, the case of countable discrete groups still provides an extensive elaboration on concepts often covered in undergraduate analysis and algebra, and, as is the case with the Banach--Tarski paradox, strike at the foundations of mathematics.
