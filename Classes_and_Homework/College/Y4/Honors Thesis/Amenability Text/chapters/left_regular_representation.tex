Just as God appears in many forms (or representations) throughout the Bible, such as the Burning Bush in the book of Exodus, so too are groups often dealt with through their representations. The field of representation theory, for instance, focuses on the properties of groups as subgroups of groups of linear transformations, and how the properties of these groups of linear transformations can provide insights into the properties of the groups themselves. Similarly, we will be engaging with the properties of groups through their representations as unitary operators acting on a Hilbert space. Soon enough, we will see that there are impressive insights about a group to be found through these unitary representations.
\section{Representing a Group}%
On a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, we know that the set of unitary operators, $\mathcal{U}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)$, is a group under composition.\footnote{To see this, note that $I_{\mathcal{H}}$ is the identity element, that $U^{\ast}U =UU^{\ast} = I_{\mathcal{H}}$, and that unitarity is preserved under composition.} Given any other group $\Gamma$, it is then tempting to consider how we can ``model'' $\Gamma$ (so to speak) as a subgroup of $\mathcal{U}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)$. This is the essence behind the idea of a unitary representation.
\begin{definition}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a group. A unitary representation of $\Gamma$ is a pair, $\left(\pi,\mathcal{H}\right)$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a Hilbert space and $\pi\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \mathcal{U}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)$ is a group homomorphism.\newline

  Furthermore, every unitary representation $U\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \mathcal{U}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)$, given by $s\mapsto U_s$, has the following properties:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item if $e$ is the identity element for $\Gamma$, then $U_{e} = I_{\mathcal{H}}$;
    \item for all $s\in \Gamma$, $U_{s}^{\ast} = U_{s^{-1}}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
  One excellent example of a unitary representation is the representation $1_{\Gamma}\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \C$, defined by $1_{\Gamma}(s) = 1$ for all $s\in\Gamma$. This is known as the trivial representation, and it will play an integral role in establishing amenability.\newline

  A more substantive unitary representation is the representation of the circle group, $\mathbb{T}\rightarrow \B\left(\ell_2\left(\Z\right)\right)$, given by $\omega \mapsto d_{\omega}$. Here, $d_{\omega}$ is the multiplication operator defined by
  \begin{align*}
    d_{\omega}\left(\left(a_{k}\right)_{k\in\Z}\right) &= \left(\omega^k a_{k}\right)_{k\in\Z}.
  \end{align*}
\end{example}
