In Chapter \ref{ch:nuclearity}, we will establish that the amenability of a group is equivalent to a property known as nuclearity held by the $C^{\ast}$-algebra(s) generated by the group. For this, we need a solid background in the theory of operator algebras --- specifically, in Banach algebras and $C^{\ast}$-algebras.
\section{Definitions}%
The theory of $C^{\ast}$-algebras is motivated by the fact that the adjoint operation on $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ (Definition \ref{def:adjoint_properties}) satisfies the criteria for an involution (Definition \ref{def:algebra_star_algebra}) on an algebra. However, one property that $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ has that a pure $\ast$-algebra lacks is the fact that $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ is equipped with a norm, $\norm{\cdot}_{\op}$, that turns $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ into a normed algebra (Definition \ref{def:norms}).\newline

What the theory of $C^{\ast}$-algebras allows us to do is abstract away from $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$. Soon, we will see that this abstraction will allow us to focus on purely algebraic properties of $C^{\ast}$-algebras and establish fundamental analytic results on them.
\begin{definition}\label{def:banach_star_algebra}
  Let $A$ be an algebra.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $\norm{\cdot}$ is such that $\left( A,\norm{\cdot} \right)$ is a Banach space that satisfies $\norm{ab}\leq \norm{a}\norm{b}$ for all $a,b\in A$, then we say $\left( A,\norm{\cdot} \right)$ is a \textit{Banach algebra}.
    \item If $A$ is a $\ast$-algebra that is also a Banach algebra, and the norm on $A$ satisfies $\norm{a^{\ast}} = \norm{a}$ for all $a\in A$, then we say $A$ is a \textit{Banach $\ast$-algebra}.
    \item If $A$ is a Banach $\ast$-algebra whose norm also satisfies $\norm{a^{\ast}a} = \norm{a}^2$ for all $a\in A$, then we say $A$ is a \textit{$C^{\ast}$-algebra}. This final property is known as the $C^{\ast}$-property.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
There are many $C^{\ast}$-algebras that we interact with as we study analysis.
\begin{example}\hfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The complex numbers, $\C$, equipped with the involution $z\mapsto \overline{z}$, are a $C^{\ast}$-algebra under the norm $\left\vert z \right\vert$.
    \item If $\mathcal{H}$ is a Hilbert space, then $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ is a $C^{\ast}$-algebra under the operator norm with the involution $T\mapsto T^{\ast}$.
    \item The space of $n\times n$ complex matrices, $\Mat_n\left( \C \right)$ under the operator norm and the involution $\left( a_{ij}^{\ast} \right)_{ij} = \left( \overline{a_{ji}} \right)_{ij}$ is a $C^{\ast}$-algebra.
    \item If $\Omega$ is any nonempty set, then the space of bounded functions, $\ell_{\infty}\left( \Omega \right)$, is a $C^{\ast}$-algebra under the norm $\norm{f}_{\ell_{\infty}} = \sup_{x\in\Omega}\left\vert f(x) \right\vert$ and the involution $f^{\ast}\left( x \right) = \overline{f(x)}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}
However, there are also some Banach $\ast$-algebras that are not $C^{\ast}$-algebras.
\begin{example}
  Let 
  \begin{align*}
    \ell_1\left( \Z \right)\coloneq \set{f\colon \Z\rightarrow\C | \norm{f}_{\ell_1} \coloneq \sum_{n\in\Z}\left\vert f(n) \right\vert < \infty}
  \end{align*}
  be equipped with the involution
  \begin{align*}
    f^{\ast}\left( n \right) &= \overline{f\left( -n \right)}
  \end{align*}
  and multiplication
  \begin{align*}
    f\ast g(n) &= \sum_{k\in\Z}f(n-k)g(k)
  \end{align*}
  is a Banach $\ast$-algebra that does not satisfy the $C^{\ast}$-property.
\end{example}
