In \cite[48]{brown_and_ozawa}, the authors remark that ``amenable groups admit approximately $10^{10^{10}}$ characterizations.'' Despite my best efforts, I was unfortunately unable to develop enough understanding of most of these characterizations of amenability, even when restricted to the case of discrete groups.
