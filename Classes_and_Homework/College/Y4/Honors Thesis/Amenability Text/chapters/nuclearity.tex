Here, we will establish the equivalence between group amenability and certain properties of the group $C^{\ast}$-algebra(s). The results in here will draw from a lot of theory that we discuss a bit more in depth in Chapter \ref{ch:operator_algebras}. Some excellent books on this topic include \cite{brown_and_ozawa} and \cite{completely_bounded_maps_and_operator_algebras}, both of which go deeper into the ramifications of the results we will present herein.
\section{Norms on the Group \texorpdfstring{$\ast$-Algebras}{*-Algebras}}%
From Definition \ref{def:group_star_algebra}, we know that for any group $\Gamma$, there is a free vector space, $\C\left[ \Gamma \right]$, consisting of finitely supported functions on $\Gamma$. Elements of $\C\left[ \Gamma \right]$ are finite sums of the form
\begin{align*}
  a &= \sum_{s\in\Gamma}a(s)\delta_s,
\end{align*}
where $\delta_s$ is the point mass function
\begin{align*}
  \delta_s\left( t \right) &= \begin{cases}
    1 & s = t\\
    0 & s\neq t
  \end{cases}.
\end{align*}
This admits a multiplication by convolution:
\begin{align*}
  f\ast g(s) &= \sum_{t\in\Gamma}f(t)g\left( t^{-1}s \right)\\
              &= \sum_{r\in\Gamma}f\left( sr^{-1} \right)g\left( r \right)
\end{align*}
and an involution
\begin{align*}
  f^{\ast}\left( t \right) &= \overline{f\left( t^{-1} \right)},
\end{align*}
which turn $\C\left[ \Gamma \right]$ into a $\ast$-algebra.\newline

Now, we are interested in applying norms on the group $\ast$-algebra, turning them into group $C^{\ast}$-algebras. We will do this through the use of unitary representations --- there is an intimate relationship between unitary representations of groups and unital representations (see Definition \ref{def:unital_representation}) of the group $\ast$-algebra generated by the group.
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 7.2.46]{rainone_analysis}}]
  Let $\Gamma$ be a group and let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space.
  \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item If $u\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \mathcal{U}\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ is a unitary representation of $\Gamma$, then $\pi_u\colon \C\left[ \Gamma \right]\rightarrow \B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$, given by
      \begin{align*}
        \pi_u(a) &= \sum_{s\in\Gamma}a(s)u_s
      \end{align*}
      is a unital representation of $\Gamma$.
    \item If $\pi\colon \C\left[ \Gamma \right]\rightarrow \B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ is a unital representation, then $u\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \mathcal{U}\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$, given by
      \begin{align*}
        u(s) &\coloneq \pi\left( \delta_s \right),
      \end{align*}
      is a unitary representation of $\Gamma$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}\hfill
  \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item Via the universal property of the free vector space, we know that the map $s\mapsto u_s\in \B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$ extends to a linear map $\pi_u\colon \C\left[ \Gamma \right]\rightarrow \B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)$. Now, we must ensure that this map is faithful to the underlying multiplication structure. Letting $s,t\in \Gamma$ be arbitrary, via the properties of unitary representations, we have
      \begin{align*}
        \pi_u\left( \delta_s\delta_t \right) &= \pi_u\left( \delta_{st} \right)\\
                                             &= u_{st}\\
                                             &= u_su_t\\
                                             &= \pi_u\left( \delta_s \right)\pi_u\left( \delta_t \right)\\
        \pi_u\left( \delta_{s}^{\ast} \right) &= \pi_u\left( \delta_{s^{-1}} \right)\\
                                              &= u_{s^{-1}}\\
                                              &= u_s^{\ast}\\
                                              &= \pi_u\left( \delta_s \right)^{\ast}.
      \end{align*}
      Therefore, via linearity, we obtain that $\pi_u$ is multiplicative and $\ast$-preserving.
    \item Every $\delta_s\in \C\left[ \Gamma \right]$ is a unitary element, and since unital $\ast$-homomorphisms preserve unitary elements (Fact \ref{fact:unitary_preservation}), we know that each $u(s)$ is unitary. Furthermore, for any $s,t\in\Gamma$, we have
      \begin{align*}
        u\left( st \right) &= \pi\left( \delta_{st} \right)\\
                           &= \pi\left( \delta_s\delta_t \right)\\
                           &= \pi\left( \delta_s \right)\pi\left( \delta_t \right)\\
                           &= u(s)u(t),
      \end{align*}
      meaning $u$ is a unitary representation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{Ordering Properties of \texorpdfstring{$C^{\ast}$-Algebras}{C*-Algebras}}%
Recall from Definition \ref{def:positive_operators} that the space $\B\left( \mathcal{H} \right)_{\sa}$ admits an order structure --- we say that an operator is \textit{positive} if, for any $\xi\in \mathcal{H}$, we have $ \iprod{T\left( \xi \right)}{\xi} \geq 0 $. It can be shown that any positive operator is of the form $T = S^{\ast}S$, where $S$ is any operator on $\mathcal{H}$.\newline

Similarly, when we discussed algebras, we discussed a definition of positivity very similar to the case of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces (Definition \ref{def:distinguished_elements_of_algebras}). We have also mentioned that the spectrum (Definition \ref{def:spectrum}) is a fundamental construct inside unital algebras.\newline

In this section, we investigate the properties of $C^{\ast}$-algebras in depth, specifically related to how to apply the properties of their spectra towards understanding ordering and positivity. This will lead naturally to discussions of positive and completely positive (linear) maps between $C^{\ast}$-algebras in the following section, paving the way to the cornucopia of characterizations of amenability that $C^{\ast}$-algebras admit.
