Welcome to my Honors Thesis landing page.
## [Paradoxical Decompositions and Tarski's Theorem](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/College/Y4/Honors Thesis/amenability_notes.pdf)
The focus here is on the Banach--Tarski paradox and Tarski's theorem.
## [Functional Analysis: Topological Vector Spaces](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/College/Y4/Honors Thesis/topological_vector_spaces.pdf)
Here, I work through a lot of first four chapters of my professor's textbook in functional analysis.
## [Invariant States and Means on Groups](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/College/Y4/Honors Thesis/invariant_states.pdf)
I work through some results related to free groups, means, invariant states, and growth rates.
## [Functional Analysis: Hilbert Spaces](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/College/Y4/Honors Thesis/hilbert_space_operators.pdf)
I work through chapters 5 and 6 of my professor's functional analysis textbook, focused on the structure of Hilbert spaces and the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space.
## [Functional Analysis: Banach and C*-Algebras](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/College/Y4/Honors Thesis/banach_cstar_algebras.pdf)
We generalize from the bounded operators on a Hilbert space to discuss Banach algebras and C*-algebras, the latter of which admit representations as bounded operators on Hilbert spaces via the GNS construction.
## [More on C*-Algebras](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/College/Y4/Honors Thesis/more_cstar_algebras.pdf)
Notes for the final part of the thesis, on the left-regular representation, Kesten's criterion, Hulanicki's criterion, and properties of the group C*-Algebras.
