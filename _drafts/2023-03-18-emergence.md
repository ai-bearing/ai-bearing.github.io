Broadly speaking, urban planning has a sordid history — the profession's most notable members include Robert Moses and Le Corbusier, the former of whom bulldozed tons of poor neighborhoods to build expressways for cars, and the latter of whom created the design of "towers in a park" that informed the former's urban development plans. I think this stems from a fundamental problem — urban planning in the modern world is distinctly *anti*-urban.

This is not a new critique — Jane Jacobs, perhaps the best well-known critic of Robert Moses, noted that cities are not some top-down design implemented by an all-knowing technocrat, but a "complex order" that arises from apparent disorder. We can imagine this as the Hayekian view of *spontaneous* order — that is, something created by humans but not designed by them. Throughout much of human history, cities maintained the social order not through special centrally-planned designs, but via norms and rules that emerged through interactions. Ideas such as "put your trash in the trash bin" or "walk on the right side of the sidewalk" aren't displayed on signs by every building, but develop through norms. Even now, with police and laws, the most common sources of order are social in nature — children know to be polite because of transmission from parents and peers, not via a police officer.

Similarly, urban development isn't necessarily a top down process, but something created through the spontaneous order process. What urban planning misses is that liberty upsets patterns, and spontaneous orders cannot be centrally planned. Of course, instead of allowing and facilitating our liberty to develop and redevelop as we see fit, urban planners decide to not only impose their patterns, but enforce them through land use regulation. There are certainly arenas for urban planners — managing externalities, designing roads, public transit, parks, and plazas, etc. — but modern "urban planning" eschews the very nature of urban development.

Robert Moses, the planners of cities such as Los Angeles and Atlanta, and generally urban planners everywhere had a vision for a car-based society, and imposed it onto us. They used land use regulation to ban lower cost, walkable housing by imposing parking mandates and unit and density limits, they rammed highways through the centers of our cities, banned new housing and businesses near public transportation, and converted remaining neighborhood streets to wide arteries.
