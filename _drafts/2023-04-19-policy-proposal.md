The basic policy proposal is an experiment of sorts to see the effects of liberalized zoning laws on the health and education outcomes of school-age children.

## Reason and Background

- Child poverty and health are significantly harmed through high housing costs and low housing quality.
- Overcrowding has a strong negative effect on student achievement, even when controlling for socioeconomic status.
- Overcrowding and rent burden are both correlated to median household income and poverty — by reducing rents, both rent burden and overcrowding can be reduced substantially.
- People of color and immigrants are disproportionately hit by high rents.
- By reducing rents, we can reduce overcrowding, improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs, and, potentially, flatten disparities in educational outcomes.

## Proposed Policies

- Identify neighborhoods with a high rate of household overcrowding, severe rent burden, and poverty, and track standardized test scores of people within the neighborhood (keeping account for the cases where they move out as well).
- Apply a substantial zoning liberalization treatment in these neighborhoods — removing most unit, density, and height limits. This is not a traditional "redevelopment," but a change of the laws.
- Enforce and inform tenants of right of return and relocation assistance, so as to minimize the negative effects of housing construction.
- School district should implement a school continuity system — students that start kindergarten in a catchment zone should be able to remain in that school after moving.
- The city should maintain high quality records of these following statistics:
  - Test scores of the students over time.
  - Overcrowding
  - Rent burden (of the particular households, regardless of where they end up)
  - Construction rates

## Overarching Goal
If our empirical data show us well, then we should expect substantial benefits to low income families and children through zoning liberalization. This should provide a strong framework for further liberalization of zoning laws throughout the city and region.
