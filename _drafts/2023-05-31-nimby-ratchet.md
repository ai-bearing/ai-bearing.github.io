The conceit is simple: your town is growing and the growth needs "management." Of course, this means zoning, it always means zoning. Because the town planners haven't read [*Arbitrary Lines*](https://blog.avinashiyer.xyz/book_reviews#arbitrary-lines), they don't know what minefield they're stepping into, but this goes farther than even what the book covers. The town planners are laying the groundwork for petty corruption — and if growth continues, much larger-scale corruption.

Zoning laws go much further than controlling for externalities or coordinating growth with infrastructure — they dictate what can be built on every single plot and parcel in a jurisdiction. Want to open a bakery? Well, you'll need 1 parking space per 200 square feet of bakery space, and you'll need to be in a C-X zone, etc. etc. Now, innocuous as it seems, zoning never just *is* what it starts out as. Though cities might grow and fall, once adopted, the zoning code stays. And, often, its dictats become more strict.

However, the strictness of the zoning code alone is not where it breeds the corruption that marks such big cities as Los Angeles and New York. In many strictly zoned cities, pretty much every new development requires an exception to the zoning that is currently on the plot — a variance that must be granted by the local politician in charge. An established developer can afford the local politician's extortion while upstarts die on the vine.

For all that conservatives say they oppose central government planning, here we have an entire industry (housing construction) which is nearly 100% controlled by local politicians, but they embrace zoning. Donald Trump and Republicans on Long Island believed that allowing new housing would lead to the death of the suburbs, after all. And, for all that progressives oppose corruption, there they are often arguing in favor of greater discretion over new housing in big cities.

The cases are numerous — Jose Huizar in Los Angeles comes to mind, but oftentimes the kind of corruption that occurs is neither visible nor actionable. Yet, it still matters. The fact of the matter is that housing is one of the most vital industries in any society, and the health of a housing market dictates, more or less, the health of the society. When zoning laws are put in place, and the ratchet begins turning, ever tightening the rules so long as local politicians can get favors for their troubles, the housing market breaks down.

If, by chance, you are in local government, and you have control over the zoning, try to push to relinquish it. It doesn't matter whether you believe you can use it for good, you simply cannot. The law must be liberal and transparent, not strict and cloistered behind the permission of particular local councilmembers. There is no substitute for liberal and transparent housing production rules.
