The ongoing "Pink Tide" rise in left-leaning Latin American leaders is not likely to last as long as the Pink Tide from the early 2000s. The first Pink Tide and its associated redistributive programs were funded primarily through high commodity prices associated with the rise of China's economy. While commodity prices increased after the COVID-19 pandemic, they are dropping substantially, and countries such as Argentina are facing other macroeconomic instability such as elevated inflation. Additionally, political instability in Latin American countries has increased dramatically, such as Jair Bolsonaro's supporters attempting to take over the Brazilian congress. These two factors — macroeconomic and political instability — are likely to lead to leaders during the current Pink Tide losing re-election.
