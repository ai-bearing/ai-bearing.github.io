There is a very common belief among the general public that math is hard (as in, people generally do poorly in it) primarily because it's abstract, and that to remedy this, we need to create more opportunities for people to engage with math concretely at a higher level (i.e., more statistics classes). Now, of course, I am personally a big fan of pure math compared to more applied fields, so when I see this kind of take, I view it from a different angle.

I generally agree with the idea, but I don't think that abstraction is necessarily a bad thing. After all, in other subjects like literature, the general public eat up fiction (while I, personally, love more nonfiction and policy work). It's not that people can't deal with abstraction â€” rather, math educators almost certainly go about abstraction in a manner that I think does injustice to the idea.

## An example from abstract algebra

A very common group in abstract algebra classes is $D_4$, or the permutation group of order 8. The idea is usually grounded in the idea of "symmetries of a square," yet another term that people seem to confuse. I will endeavour to provide an explanation of $D_4$ with a better understanding of its connection from concrete to abstract.

Imagine a square where we have labeled the vertices. A "symmetry" in this case represents a movement of the square such that, after the actions, the new square appears within the "shadow" of the original square.

The $f$ in $D_4$ *represents* a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation. Note that it *isn't* a counterclockwise rotation, but it does have the properties of one. So, we know that we can apply a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation four times before returning back to the original square. This is synonymous with $f^4 = e$ in $D_4$, where $e$ represents the symmetry of doing nothing.

The $g$ in $D_4$ *represents* flipping the square around a vertical line. This means it has similar properties to flipping along a vertical line, meaning that applying it twice yields.
