Expectations:

- respond and receive responses quickly

We are in the communication business. Use slack like it's a text message board. Don't ghost anyone.

Intentionality is key. Remember your own perspective when you talk with staff writers.

We are in charge of our section, and we must be proud with the result of every week's section. We're all still writers and learning from them.

Ordering: Life > School > Newspaper (i.e., make sure you're healthy and happy, look forward to working at the paper)

Thursdays are the day off (except for opinions).

Respect is foundational.

What Editors Do:

1) Create pitches that people will want to read. Sundays: pre-pitch
2) Editing stories: follow AP Style, send writers to Barbara, remember that you're not the writer, and it's not your job to rip the story apart. It's the writer's byline.
3) Mentorship: hold their hands, especially for young writers.
4) Corrections: sent to writer first, then put on website. Spelling of names *must* be correct. 


How to come up with story ideas:
1) There's a story in everything. Find stories that you would want to read yourself.
