Ah yes, it's that time of the year. [Another mass shooting](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nashville-christian-school-shooter-appears-former-student-police-chief-rcna76876) — this time in Nashville, Tennessee. Just like every other time, we will hear yet another call for gun control, and it will fail just like every other time. The main reason why I believe gun control will fail is not the NRA — they have been bankrupt since 2019, and generally are a non-factor in why gun control fails. The real reason is simply that America is steeped in gun culture. We will never ban guns — but, we can hope to change the culture so that owning a gun, legal or not, is a bad thing.

## The myth of the "good guy with a gun"

Every time there is a mass shooting, we hear from various people something along the lines of the following:

> The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

As much as American liberals like to believe it, they have succumbed to this belief. The fact is that, regardless of whether one is a law-abiding citizen or not, *owning* a gun is the problem. And, more specifically, owning a *handgun* is the problem. There is no such thing as a good guy with a gun.

But first, some facts. Most gun deaths are neither mass shootings (which make up around 3% of deaths), nor are they even homicides. The most common source of gun deaths is [suicides](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/). Suicides are overwhelmingly impulsive and method-dependent — when the United Kingdom phased out the use of coal gas, [suicide rates plummeted](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/saves-lives/). Of course, gun deaths aren't the only problem with gun ownership — there are the numerous accidents, unintended shootings, death threats, etc. that are enabled and made more likely by mass gun ownership.

Additionally, and crucially, many handguns are stolen from the "law-abiding gun owners" — some might believe that countries with strict firearm laws would necessarily have more illegal guns (because prohibition creates a black market), but in this case, the strict firearm laws prevent guns from proliferating, so there are fewer guns in the country to begin with, so fewer illegal guns. In the good old US-of-A, there is a rash of illegal guns precisely because there is a rash of *legal* guns.

## "Self Defense"

Of course, some might say that the reason people have guns in their house is for self-defense. However, even then that is questionable. The high end of the estimates on lives saved via self defense — around 2.5 million per year — often come from self-reported surveys of gun owners, who often include clear escalations through the introduction of a gun into the picture.

More generally, it's important to understand that, yet again, suicides are the most common form of gun death. The introduction of a gun into a household vastly *decreases* the safety of people in the household by, once again, making it easier for people in the household to die. Guns are a tool — a tool designed to kill people, the preponderance of which is themselves. Introducing a gun into a household "for self defense" will often mean introduction of the gun into the household that ends up killing or seriously wounding one of the residents of the household.

Of course we need better mental health support, of course we need to change various practices and policies to help relieve stress in society, but that won't solve the problem of a depressed person with a gun having an extremely bad day and having the easy ability to off themselves — only not having a gun in the household will keep that nightmare from becoming a reality.

## On norms vs. laws

Norms are a very powerful thing — like I said in a previous post, we know that norms often govern our society in more subtle and powerful ways than laws do. In the absence of laws, however, we can still develop norms and societal rules around gun ownership, and ideally ones that make it clear that gun ownership is a bad thing. People may have the right to own guns, but they shouldn't exercise that right, and we should stigmatize people who do exercise their right to own a gun and pressure them to bury or throw away their guns.

There isn't a legal solution on the horizon anytime soon — we can only hope for norms. And we need to create a strong norm against *legal* gun ownership. That is the only possible solution on the horizon.
