There are an increasing number of stories about a growing [teen mental health crisis](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144354315/understanding-the-mental-health-crisis-afflicting-american-teens), and more specifically how it has increased dramatically in recent years. I don't know what exactly might have caused it, but I do know that I can probably provide a perspective as just one data point in this constellation of mental health challenges among the young generation. Hopefully, in the process, if anyone sees this, they'll get at least a little bit of understanding for how mental health challenges impact people.

I've had off-and-on mental health challenges since around the beginning of middle school, mostly centered around academics. For reference, I went to one of the most notorious public high schools in the Bay Area — this place was affluent, disproportionately Asian, and competitive to a degree that shocks even the parents who purposefully move to my hometown to send their kids to the public schools. Ground zero for a mental health crisis — and indeed, there was a suicide at this high school before I entered it — but more importantly, it reflects a larger set of cultural values around mental health that are rampant, especially in the Indian American community.

Indian Americans are a very successful minority group in the United States — our median incomes are higher than the median income in the country as a whole, we are much more likely to have a college degree, and many members of our community work in highly-paid STEM fields. However, this comes at a cost — namely, the second generation's mental health. There's a long running joke that second gen Indian Americans are the least patriotic group about India — and rightly so, because our parents put us through hell.

Everything is about outward presentation; we only exist for the purpose of pleasing others. I can tell countless stories about how my parents would let the house fall into disrepair and mess... until there was someone visiting, then we cleaned up in one fell swoop before they arrived. Keeping up appearances is everything — and for children, this means working yourself to the bone academically. Mental health is an afterthought, a luxury which only the whitewashed second generation cares about.

This has been my experience. It's almost ingrained into my DNA that I should, at any cost, keep up appearances. Even if I accept my vulerability, or even talk about it openly as I am right now, I should not let that ever mean I lose what's most important — grades and class attendance. Of course, this is exhausting — paired with possible undiagnosed conditions, the fundamental imperative to keep up appearances has meant I usually consume 500 milligrams of caffeine a day (and it would be a lot more were it not for a self-imposed limit). I've experienced my fair share of mental breakdowns and snapped at the most banal of phenomena, and every so often felt like the world would be better without my existence.

And, I'm not going to change anything. Weirdly enough, I've never felt the same kind of existential anxiety that others might have — after all, I'm broadly someone who trusts in markets and technology, and I believe that we will find innovations that will defeat climate change — but instead I just know deep down that my depression is unbeatable. The choices are either "keep up appearances despite mental health challenges" and "death" — there is no secret third option wherein I become healthy again.

So, my mental health will continue to be neglected. I'll be (outwardly) fine, though — you'll still see me keeping up appearances.
