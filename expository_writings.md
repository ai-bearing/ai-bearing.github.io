I'm going to begin writing shorter, more coherent notes on certain topics (primarily focused on early graduate-level topics in the three main theoretical mathematics topics). These will be shorter than than the traditional notes that can be found in my [Class Notes](classnotes.md) section, in part because in graduate school, I plan on taking most of my notes with pencil and paper, and feel like it's better to focus on a shorter writing style.
## Algebra

## Analysis
The following are standard texts.
- _Real and Complex Analysis_ (Rudin)
- _Real Analysis_ (Folland)
- _Real Analysis_ (Royden and Fitzpatrick)
- _Measure, Integration, and Real Analysis_ (Axler)
- _Princeton Lectures on Analysis_ (Stein and Shakarchi)

### [Inequalities and the $L_p$-Spaces](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/inequalities.pdf)
> We introduce some of the most important inequalities that are used frequently in real and functional analysis. These inequalities include Jensen's inequality and Young's inequality (concerning convex functions), which are then used to prove HÃ¶lder's inequality and Minkowski's inequality (concerning $p$-norms). Afterwards, we define the $L_p$-spaces and show that they are complete.

## Topology
The following are standard texts.
- _A Taste of Topology_ (Runde)
- _Topology_ (Munkres)
- _An Introduction to Algebraic Topology_ (Rotman)

### [Urysohn's Lemma](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/urysohns_lemma.pdf)
> We detail the construction necessary to prove Urysohn's Lemma, which completely characterizes normal topological spaces via separation using continuous functions.

## Miscellaneous
