### [Useful Inequalities in Analysis](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes and Homework/After College/Expository Writings/inequalities.pdf)
> We introduce some of the most important inequalities that are used frequently in real and functional analysis. These inequalities include Jensen's inequality and Young's inequality (concerning convex functions), HÃ¶lder's inequality and Minkowski's inequality (concerning $p$-norms), finishing with the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality in $L_2\left( \Omega,\mu \right)$.
