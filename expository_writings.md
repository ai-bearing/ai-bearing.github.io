I'm going to begin writing shorter, more coherent notes on certain topics (primarily focused on early graduate-level topics in the three main theoretical mathematics topics). These will be shorter than than the traditional notes that can be found in my [Class Notes](classnotes.md) section, in part because in graduate school, I plan on taking most of my notes with pencil and paper, and feel like it's better to focus on a shorter writing style.

All the results, proofs, etc. in all documents that follow are not my own; I do not include citations within the specific texts because keeping track of them all would be too difficult.
## Algebra
The following are standard texts.
- _Algebra, Chapter 0_ (Aluffi)
- _Abstract Algebra_ (Dummit and Foote)
- _Algebra_ (Lang)

### [Conjugation and the Sylow Theorems](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/conjugation_and_sylow_theorems.pdf)
> We discuss the nuances of the conjugation action in groups, and use it to prove the Sylow theorems. We then use the Sylow theorems to classify the nature of groups of a particular order.

## Analysis
The following are standard texts.
- _Real and Complex Analysis_ (Rudin)
- _Real Analysis_ (Folland)
- _Real Analysis_ (Royden and Fitzpatrick)
- _Measure, Integration, and Real Analysis_ (Axler)
- _Princeton Lectures on Analysis_ (Stein and Shakarchi)
- _A Course in Functional Analysis_ (Conway)
- _Sequences and Series in Banach Spaces_ (Diestel)
- _An Introduction to Banach Space Theory_ (Megginson)

### [Inequalities and the $L_p$-Spaces](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/inequalities.pdf)
> We introduce some of the most important inequalities that are used frequently in real and functional analysis. These inequalities include Jensen's inequality and Young's inequality (concerning convex functions), which are then used to prove HÃ¶lder's inequality and Minkowski's inequality (concerning $p$-norms). Afterwards, we define the $L_p$-spaces and show that they are complete.

### [Egorov's Theorem and Lusin's Theorem](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/egorovs_theorem_lusins_theorem.pdf)
> The mathematician J.E. Littlewood introduced three principles of real analysis: every measurable set is nearly a finite union of intervals, every measurable function is nearly continuous, and every pointwise convergent sequence is nearly uniformly convergent. Here, we prove (ii) and (iii), which are the substance of Lusin's Theorem and Egorov's Theorem respectively.

### [Extreme Points, the Krein--Milman Theorem, and Applications](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/extreme_points_krein_milman_stone_weierstrass.pdf)
> We discuss extremal structure in locally convex topological vector spaces, as well as a fundamental result in the theory of topological vector spaces: the Krein--Milman theorem. We also use extremal structure to prove the Stone--Weierstrass Theorem and the Banach--Stone theorem.

## Topology
The following are standard texts.
- _A Taste of Topology_ (Runde)
- _Topology_ (Munkres)
- _An Introduction to Algebraic Topology_ (Rotman)

### [Urysohn's Lemma](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/urysohns_lemma.pdf)
> We detail the construction necessary to prove Urysohn's Lemma, which completely characterizes normal topological spaces via separation using continuous functions.
