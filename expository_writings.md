### [Inequalities and the $L_p$-Spaces](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/inequalities.pdf)
> We introduce some of the most important inequalities that are used frequently in real and functional analysis. These inequalities include Jensen's inequality and Young's inequality (concerning convex functions), HÃ¶lder's inequality and Minkowski's inequality (concerning $p$-norms) --- then, we use these to define the $L_p$-spaces and show some basic properties such as completeness and the $L_p$/$L_q$ duality.
