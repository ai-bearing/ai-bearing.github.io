I'm going to begin writing shorter, more coherent notes on certain topics (primarily focused on early graduate-level topics in the three main theoretical mathematics topics). These will be shorter than than the traditional notes that can be found in my [Class Notes](classnotes.md) section, in part because in graduate school, I plan on taking most of my notes with pencil and paper, and feel like it's better to focus on a shorter writing style.

### [Inequalities and the $L_p$-Spaces](https://ai-bearing.github.io/Classes_and_Homework/After College/Expository Writings/inequalities.pdf)
> We introduce some of the most important inequalities that are used frequently in real and functional analysis. These inequalities include Jensen's inequality and Young's inequality (concerning convex functions), HÃ¶lder's inequality and Minkowski's inequality (concerning $p$-norms) --- then, we use these to define the $L_p$-spaces and show some basic properties such as completeness and the $L_p$/$L_q$ duality.
