They’re both philosophers rather than politicians or policymakers, but the book is nonetheless a great overview of the problems of the current criminal justice system and where we can find solutions. Paired with a few other pieces of evidence (like <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/underpoliced-and-overprisoned-revisited.html">this from Brookings</a> and <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/underpoliced-and-overprisoned-revisited.html">this from Alex Tabarrok</a>), I think it’s a great example of the fundamental problem facing both “tough on crime” politicians and police abolitionists.</p>

<p>I’m sympathetic to the police abolitionists in LA — the police are at best incompetent and at worst <a href="https://knock-la.com/tradition-of-violence-lasd-gang-history/">in literal gangs</a>. However, given that crime has increased somewhat since the early-2010s lows, I think it’s fair to say there is a lot of public appetite for some form of “tough on crime” politics (look to New York’s election results for a prime example). In pretty much every society, we will spend approximately 2% of GDP on police + prisons combined. The main problem is that, in America, we spend the bulk of this spending on prisons.</p>

<p>Prisons, for obvious reasons, are very bad. The Eighth Amendment in the United States is meant to ban “cruel and unusual punishment,” yet in <em>Injustice for All</em>, Brennan and Surprenant advance a quite powerful argument that flogging (or caning, as they use in Singapore) is a more humane alternative to prison. However, of course, flogging is cruel and unusual — yet if you were faced with the free choice between 10 lashings (after which you convalesce and are set free) or 5 years in prison, you would probably choose the lashings.</p>

<p>We might think that the increase in incarceration in the 1980s and 90s was because of the War on Drugs, but really it wasn’t. Most people are imprisoned in state prisons, predominantly for violent crimes of which they are guilty, and the average sentence is 4 years (which did not increase substantially during the massive rise in incarceration). The main reason that prisons increased in population were twofold — we had more crime, and we prosecuted a lot more people. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, prosecutors created and honed the practice of plea bargaining, which a legal commentator at the time compared to <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4154&amp;context=uclrev">torture</a>.</p>

<p>The practice of jury trials is meant to limit who goes to prison — after all, prison is probably the pinnacle of the power of the government to restrict people’s freedoms — but nowadays the jury trial is basically dead. Over 95% of state prison cases are pleaded out — most of the cases may be guilty, but if prosecutors wanted to obtain a guilty verdict, they should have gone through the typical trial system, or dismissed the case. In absence of this kind of reform being politically possible, I want to propose something similar to what Clark Neily <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/jury-out-thats-problem">proposes</a> in reducing the cases of plea bargains. Namely, trial lotteries: for every case where a plea bargain is offered, there is a 10% chance that the case still goes to trial for the given plea. If the prosecutor obtains a guilty verdict, the defendant is sentenced. Otherwise, if the prosecutor does not obtain a guilty verdict, the prosecutor is immediately fired and disbarred.</p>

<p>Incarceration, aside from being cruel, is also ineffective. There was a lot of controversy over the <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/11/15/dc-council-will-vote-overhaul-criminal-code/">DC Criminal Code rewrite</a> for limiting the maximum sentence for carjacking, but realistically no one who commits a carjacking is worried about whether they get sentenced for 24 years versus 40 years in prison. The main problem is that, in Beccaria’s hierarchy of deterrence, certainty of being caught is much more important than severity of the punishment if caught. This is why I believe that police and prisons are a tradeoff that we are on the wrong side of — if you spend more on prisons, then you spend less on police, and police are the “certainty” arm of deterrence while prisons are the “severity” arm.</p>

<p>Therefore, we have reached the main problem — police are funded locally, while prisons are funded at the state level. Local police are by and large a cartel who exact <a href="https://payroll.mejiaforcontroller.com">massive compensation packages</a> in exchange for very little actual success, thanks to their powerful unions. So, when crime spikes, cities are unable to hire new police officers, and any increase in police funding is directed towards paying for gold plated benefits for existing, unproductive cops (who cannot be easily fired nor <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">sued for misconduct</a>), so the alternative the public turns to is imprisonment, which is cruel and ineffective.</p>

<p>I think the following is a good framework for fixing this fundamental incentive problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fire every police officer in every city and reconstitute police departments at the state level, with no allowance for unionization and abolition of state-level qualified immunity.</li>
  <li>Greatly increase court staffing in order to process jury trials faster.</li>
  <li>Implement the trial lottery system detailed above.</li>
  <li>Create a civil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_v._Wainwright"><em>Gideon</em></a> and direct more lower level crimes into tort law.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, none of these will singlehandedly solve the mass incarceration crisis or the policies that tempt mass incarceration, but they will mollify some of the opposition to reducing the level of cruelty in our prison system, and alleviate crime problems in the process. There are a lot of other ideas that are somewhat tangential (though important) in reducing rates of crime, but this is narrowly focused while still being much more constructive.</p>]]></content><author><name>Avinash Iyer</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently read the book Injustice for All by Chris Surprenant and Jason Brennan.

I can sorta kinda get where they’re coming from — after 50+ years of harsh restrictions on new housing construction, every new building will command expensive rents that most people, especially in a poor city like LA, cannot afford.</p>

<p>However, especially for policymakers who have access to the most up-to-date information on this stuff, asking a question like “affordable for whom?” should be a disqualifier. At best, this question is asked in bad faith, and at worst it’s meant for the sole purpose of using the <a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Nirvana-Fallacy">Nirvana Fallacy</a> to block new housing. Oftentimes the people who most deftly use such a fallacy are rich, suburban NIMBYs such as John Mirisch of Beverly Hills, who was recently <a href="https://www.beverlyhills.org/citymanager/newsroom/councilmemberjohnmirischelectedasboardmemberoflacountysnewaffordablehousingsolutionsagency/">unanimously appointed</a> to a sham taxpayer-funded board for “affordable housing solutions” that will not under any circumstances entertain a solution that includes “building more housing in rich suburbs like Beverly Hills.”</p>

<p>Of course, I think the most corrosive case of this is in the Los Angeles City Council. We know the usual suspects like the San Fernando Valley councilmembers who all believe that LA can’t possibly allow more housing in the mostly-SFZ region, or let alone the Westside council members of Traci Park and Katy Young Yaroslavsky who still believe their affluent segregated fiefdoms are somehow places where the working class can live. But, I think the most corrosive of them  all is Eunisses Hernandez. During her campaign, she <a href="https://archive.ph/Iigtp">consistently villified</a> the construction of new apartments in CD 1 (her council district), and tried to run on an effective moratorium on private market rate housing in the district (you know, barring the fact that she is a homeowner in private market rate housing in CD 1).</p>

<p>I’m not going to say that Hernandez is all bad — I share a lot of similar beliefs with her regarding criminal justice, and I don’t think she’s unmovable, but I do believe that given the coalition she has built up, she will be substantially worse than her predecessor, Gil Cedillo. For example, she blamed new “market rate and luxury construction” on gentrification in Pico-Union and Chinatown (two of the poorest neighborhoods in Los Angeles) — of course, the more affluent neighborhood of Highland Park where she is from has built virtually no new apartments since the 1990s and has gentrified substantially. Additionally, the message doesn’t seem to have been <a href="https://observablehq.com/@yanofsky/la-city-council-election-results">taken too well</a>, considering she lost in both Chinatown and Pico-Union, and primarily won in homeowner-heavy Highland Park and Mount Washington.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m just being cynical here, and it isn’t right for me to focus my ire on Hernandez of all councilmembers. However, I think that every councilmember deserves to be called out for their policies leading to devastating consequences — Hernandez’s tenure will not lead to lower cost housing, and will have devastating impacts on the people she claims to care most about. Or, alternatively, she’s just doing what the Northeast LA homeowners ask of her.</p>

<p>One of my most firm beliefs is that people have the right to a competent government given its effects on the lives of everyone. Eunisses Hernandez, Katy Young Yaroslavsky, Hugo Soto-Martinez, and Nithya Raman (the progressive bloc on LA City Council) aren’t stupid — after all, they all got elected to one of the most powerful local government bodies in the country — and given this power, they have a moral duty to actually pass policies that have evidence backing them up, not to just kowtow to their specific bases (be they homeowners or temporarily embarrassed homeowners).</p>]]></content><author><name>Avinash Iyer</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s common, especially in Los Angeles, for politicians and activists to ask “affordable for whom?” when new housing (deed-restricted for low income people or not) is proposed.

The main exceptions where I think there’s a strong enough reason for the government to intervene to control this is in the case of antibiotics. And, additionally, I think it would be preferable to get rid of mandated prescription requirements for drugs as well. There’s a few reasons why.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of informed consent, a person is the ultimate person in control of their own body — this means that they’re allowed to deny themselves treatment even if doing so may harm them (or even kill them). I don’t think that this doctrine should be thrown out of the window when it comes to patients making their own decisions on what drugs they may or may not consume (provided proper information and understanding of risk). This is one of the main arguments put forward by Jessica Flanigan in <em>Pharmaceutical Freedom</em> and her associated papers, which are a great resource I recommend everyone read.</p>

<p>I think one of the more severe consequences of restricting the ability for people to self-medicate is twofold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consumption of more dangerous drug alternatives</li>
  <li>loss of potential new drugs</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, we may understand a lot of the current phase of the opioid crisis through the first lens — a lot of people, unable to use prescription opioids for pain management, turned to heroin and then fentanyl, which are much, much more dangerous than prescription opioids themselves. Illegal drugs are harmful <em>because</em> they’re illegal — drug users cannot get their products certified as safe, or get them tested for harmful substances. There is some movement on this with greater access to fentanyl testing strips, but the drug overdose death rates have still taken a massive toll.</p>

<p>Additionally, the current system of drug regulation (i.e., the Food and Drug Administration’s efficacy testing regime after the Kefauver amendments) severely constrains the ability for new drugs to get to market, as well as being time consuming for drugs that eventually do get to market. One of the most infamous examples may be the fact that it took 7 years for azidothymidine, an anti-HIV/AIDS drug, to get to market. Of course part of this is the set of incentives that a FDA regulator has, but it is still quite unconscionable to let drugs or vaccines lay in wait while a crisis is going on. A more recent example might be the vaccines for COVID, which were created only weeks after the discovery of the virus, in January 2020, but still weren’t approved for general public use until January 2021.</p>

<p>Of course, you might say that it’s worth it to implement this strict system of prescription requirements, criminalization, and drug regulation in order to protect the public. However, at the same time, one of the most dangerous drugs, one with very few if any health benefits, is perfectly legal to consume without prescription for anyone above the age of 21 — alcohol. I personally detest alcohol, but it is very prominent in many cultures, which is why I’m not okay with doing a full on alcohol prohibition.</p>

<p>At the same time, alcohol has major social costs — a paper from South Africa found that their sudden alcohol prohibition during COVID-19 reduced injury-induced mortality by at least <a href="https://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2022/ii22-301.pdf">14%</a>, and more generally that alcohol <a href="https://www.nber.org/reporter/fall-2001/alcohol-and-violence#N_5_">fuels a lot of violence</a> in our society. Yet, because our culture is so ingrained in alcohol, we don’t prohibit it to the same extent we did COVID vaccines during the pandemic, or antiretrovirals during the AIDS crisis.</p>

<p>I’m not proposing prohibiting alcohol, either. I just want to bring forth the juxtaposition between important drugs that save numbers of lives (and other drugs like adderall that allow people with ADHD to function normally that are also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/health/adderall-shortage-adhd/index.html">de facto banned</a>) but were caught up in the arcane system of drug regulation and prescription requirements, and the dangerous drug with major social costs that is so ingrained within our culture that we separate it from “drugs.”</p>

<p>Of course, the case of controlling antibiotics is very obvious — namely, consuming antibiotics does affect other people much more than consuming other drugs, which is that overconsumption leads to development of antibiotic resistant bacteria like MRSA.</p>

<p>What would be my solution? It’s probably a mixture of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove all drugs from the scheduling of the Controlled Substances Act</li>
  <li>Harmonize FDA approvals with the European Medical Association and Health Canada’s HPFB.</li>
  <li>Allow people to consume drugs that aren’t approved by the FDA (provided proper informed consent), as well as remove mandates on prescription requirements.</li>
  <li>Allow private companies (similar to Underwriters Laboratory) to certify drugs as safe and effective alongside the FDA.</li>
  <li>Redirect saved money to voluntary addiction treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not one of those types of people who believes that all problems would be solved if only we all smoked cannabis, but I do believe that there are a lot of other, more pressing issues in our society than whether someone consumes a drug that they understand the risks of taking, and directing our resources to those more pressing issues would be more effective.</p>]]></content><author><name>Avinash Iyer</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my more outlier opinions is that I think we should legalize (almost all) drugs for anyone above the age of 18.

To an extent, I really do still view him as one of the greatest players of all time. Additionally, he was not only a great player, but active in movements for racial justice and dignity for all regardless of their skin color, gender, or income level.</p>

<p>Well, there’s a reason I say “used to.” Steph Curry is <a href="https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2023/01/27/steph-and-ayesha-curry-oppose-upzoning-of-atherton-property-near-their-home">a NIMBY</a>. I don’t really care whether it’s for privacy reasons (though if I’m being honest, Steph is from Atherton, he’s going to be fine if they build some townhouses near his house). He cannot, in good faith, consider himself an advocate for racial justice.</p>

<p>Atherton is a city founded on exclusion — a realtor from there sought to turn the entirety of San Francisco and San Mateo counties into a whites-only sundown town, and even now it is both much whiter and much, much richer than the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area (itself one of the richest parts of the world). Atherton itself used to have a Caltrain station… until they shut it down because they didn’t want to face the possibility of (gasp) apartments in their community. The city is built on the belief that if you want to live there, you can only be one of the elite. This might be slightly acceptable… except that Atherton is located within one of the most important metropolitan areas in our technological age. Exclusion on the basis of race (which morphed into exclusion on the basis of class), cannot be allowed.</p>

<p>Steph Curry isn’t an idiot — the letter even states that they don’t want to use “not in our backyard” language — and he knows that NIMBYism is wrong. No matter to him, because when he finally had the tiniest bit of skin in the game now that he might have to deal with the shock of someone slightly poorer than him living next door, he folded. I’m sorry Steph, I can’t think of you as a person in the pursuit of justice anymore. You were always a fraud, and it only took this time to prove it.</p>

<p>Of course, you can always change for the better. Atherton is currently subject to the <a href="https://www.yimbylaw.org/buildersremedy">Builder’s Remedy</a>, and you could always commission to turn your house into a large apartment building so many people can live in the exclusive community you currently call home. It’s only fair.</p>]]></content><author><name>Avinash Iyer</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to love Steph Curry, NBA MVP, point guard extraordinaire, and darling of the San Francisco Bay Area.
