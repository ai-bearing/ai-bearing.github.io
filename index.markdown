Hi. I'm Avinash.

## Who am I?
I am a first-year mathematics PhD student at the University of Virginia.

For Fall 2025, I am a discussion leader for a section of Calculus II (Math 1320), as well as the grader for Advanced Linear Algebra (Math 4651).

## [My CV](https://ai-bearing.github.io/CV/cv_2.pdf)

## Interests
I primarily like theoretical mathematics, mostly oriented around functional analysis and operator algebras. I did my honors thesis on amenability and my REU was in complex analysis.
