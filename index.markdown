Hi, I'm Avinash. 

## Who am I?
I am a first-year mathematics PhD student at the University of Virginia. I got my undergraduate degree from Occidental College, where I studied math and was an editor of the opinions section for the school's newspaper. I also participated in an REU at East Texas A&M University where my group worked on Toeplitz operators acting on weighted Bergman spaces.

For Spring 2026, I am a learning assistant for Elementary Linear Algebra and a grader for Survey of Algebra.

## [My CV](https://ai-bearing.github.io/CV/cv_2.pdf)

## Interests
I primarily like theoretical mathematics, mostly oriented around functional analysis and operator algebras. I did my honors thesis on amenability and my REU was in complex analysis.
