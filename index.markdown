Hi. I'm Avinash. You have stumbled upon my website. Welcome! 

## Who I am
I am a mathematics major at Occidental College. I mostly created this website in order to store my class notes and other important documents in the cloud without needing to resort to Google Drive (a service I dislike greatly) or Overleaf (which is wholly inadequate to manage my in-class typed notes).

## [My CV](https://ai-bearing.github.io/CV/cv_2.pdf)

## Interests
I'm interested in a lot of things, but I think the following form a reasonable set of representatives of equivalence classes for these interests:
- Mathematics
- Physical and mental health
- Strength training and weightlifting
- Economic history and political economy
