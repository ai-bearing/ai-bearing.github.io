Hi, I'm Avinash. I'm a math and economics major at Occidental College, and you appear to have stumbled upon my website. Welcome!

I'm primarily going to be using this to host my various work results, posting some opinions and commentary on discourse happening in the real world, and maybe making some blog posts about various math and economics topics. Hopefully you enjoy!
