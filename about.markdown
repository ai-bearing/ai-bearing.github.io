Hi, I'm Avinash. I'm a math and economics major at Occidental College, and you appear to have stumbled upon my website. Welcome!

I'm primarily going to be using this to host my classwork and homework (and possible research work in the future), as well as various blog posts pontificating on urban planning, economics, math, and the intersection of some (or all) of them. I hope you find this stuff interesting.
