Hi, I'm Avinash. I'm a mathematics major and economics minor at Occidental College. My main academic interest is in mathematical analysis; my REU over summer 2024 was in complex analysis, and the main PhD programs I am searching out are ones with an emphasis in operator theory and operator algebras.

Outside of academics, I'm also an opinions editor at the student-run newspaper known as *The Occidental*, and I enjoy strength training and weightlifting.
