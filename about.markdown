Hi, I'm Avinash. I'm a mathematics major and economics minor at Occidental College. My main academic interest is in mathematical analysis; my REU over summer 2024 was in complex analysis, and the main PhD programs I applied to were ones with strong groups working in operator theory and operator algebras. However, I'm still flexible on what I really want to study.

Outside of academics, I'm also an opinions editor at the award-winning student-run newspaper known as *The Occidental*, and I enjoy climbing, weightlifting, and volleyball.
