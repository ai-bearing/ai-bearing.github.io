Hi, I'm Avinash. I'm a mathematics major at Occidental College. My main academic interest is in mathematical analysis; my REU over summer 2024 was in complex analysis, and the main PhD programs I applied to (and the ones I plan on going to) have strong functional analysis programs. I really enjoy research, teaching, and find proper exposition of the utmost importance â€” my honors thesis is focused on amenability, a topic that is a beautiful symphony of concepts that occur throughout undergraduate mathematics, but proper exposition of which is often elided.

Outside of academics, I'm also an opinions editor at the award-winning student-run newspaper known as *The Occidental*, and I enjoy climbing, weightlifting, and volleyball.
