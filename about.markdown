Hi, I'm Avinash. I am an incoming mathematics PhD student to the University of Virginia. I got my undergraduate degree from Occidental College, where I studied math and was an opinions editor for the school's newspaper. I also participated in an REU at East Texas A&M University where my group worked on Toeplitz operators acting on weighted Bergman spaces.

Outside of math, I enjoy making origami and lifting in the gym.
