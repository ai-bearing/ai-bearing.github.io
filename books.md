 <summary> <em>Land and Liberty: Henry George and the Making of Modern Liberalism</em>, Christopher England </summary>

<p>Christopher England, a historian at Georgetown University, wrote an excellent history of the influence of Henry George, starting through the mid-1800s, during the time of slavery's abolition and the restructuring of the American economy during the post-civil war industrialization. England masterfully documents the influence that the seminal thinker of this time period, Henry George, had throughout the political system.</p>

<p>Henry George was born in 1839 in Philadelphia, his father an officer in the customs house. This urban upbringing was distinctly different from most Americans of the time, who primarily lived in rural areas. The Jeffersonian ideal of the time posited that rural life, with each person tending their personal farms, was more "virtuous" than urban living, but George, having been raised in an urban area, flipped this idea on its head. At age 14, George left home to join a merchant ship that traveled to India and back, where he learned to sympathize deeply with poverty.</p>

<p>Soon after returning from the ship, George worked his way toward California and its major city of the time, San Francisco, where George decided to try to make it in the printing business. There, he met and married Annie George, while he was without a cent to his name, but he stayed faithful throughout his life nonetheless. According to George, he came close to killing a rich man should that man not have given him 5 dollars, with which he was able to turn his life around.</p>

<p>While in San Francisco, he started the <em>San Francisco Times</em>, where he started writing editorials. His first popular work, <em>What the Railroads Will Bring Us</em>, argued that whatever benefits the railroads brought to California through lower transportation costs would be eaten up in higher land rents. In 1871, Henry George then had his most major realization while riding in the East Bay hills:</p>

<blockquote>I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to say, what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off that they looked like mice, and said, "I don't know exactly, but there is a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre." Like a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with advancing wealth. With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.</blockquote>

<p>The central question of why, with so much progress, was there so much poverty, would be answered through the advancement of land rents. The remedy, as George saw it, was abolishing special privileges, most especially the privilege that was private ownership of land. This doesn't mean that private <em>use</em> was abolished, but rather that the value of the privilege, land rent, was to be owned by all.</p>

<p>George was not a mere theorist, however — while <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, where he published this thesis and its remedy, was a smash hit in and of itself, George was also someone who deeply believed in the power of politics to improve working people's lives. Along the way, he recruited an unlikely group of elite supporters. Tom Johnson, a streetcar monopolist in Cleveland, joined the cause after seeing a worker read Henry George's <em>Social Problems</em>, after which he read <em>Progress and Poverty</em> and failed to find any fault with the line of argumentation. Afterward, Johnson met with George, where George told Johnson to enter politics in order to enact the remedies at a local level.</p>

<p>George, for his own matter, ended up moving to New York and running for mayor on the United Labor ticket with the support of the Central Labor Union. George promised to municipalize the ownership of the streetcar network, abolish the police force, and municipalize the land so as to ensure that its rise in value would benefit everyone. Sadly, he failed, possibly due to tampering on the part of Tammany Hall, the local political machine. However, his movement was rock-solid, and gained followers throughout the country.</p>

<p>Georgists, who started referring to themselves as "single taxers," first entered the national limelight on the question of tariff rates. Henry George was an avowed free trader, as detailed in his book <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, which Tom Johnson and four other Georgist congressmen read into the Congressional Record and, via their franking privilege, mailed out to their constituents. At a municipal level, Georgists were primarily invested in a few major issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax Assessment reform: assessors such as J.J. Pastoriza in Houston sought to increase the share of property taxation and valuation that was focused on the land underneath properties.</li>
<li>Municipal governance reform: Georgists advocated for municipal home rule, believing that more powers at local governments would serve their purposes by allowing more leeway for local administrators to implement George's remedies. However, this would end up backfiring during the age of suburbanization. Similarly, Georgists such as William Simon U'Ren advocated for initiative, referendum, and recall in order to implement land value taxation.</li>
<li>Public ownership: Georgists believed there should be a strict separation between the public and private realms, which enclosed on ideas such as taxation or regulation. The idea was that natural monopolies such as power, water, and railroads/streetcar networks should be owned and operated by the government, so as to avoid corruption.</li>
</ul>

<p>England documents the influence that the Georgists had at nearly every level of government — from local levels in mayors such as Tom Johnson in Cleveland (which the journalist Lincoln Steffens called the best-governed city in America at the time) and William Jay Gaynor of New York (whose implementation of land value tax-like reforms facilitated a large building boom), to state level reformers in California and Ohio, to national figures such as Louis Post and George Creel, who served in the Wilson Administration. Sadly, after World War 1 and the ensuing suburbanization facilitated by the automobile and racist FHA loans, George's influenced diminished. However, it still carried on even up through the New Deal with figures such as Raymond Moley, who served in FDR's Brain Trust before turning against the New Deal in the mid-1930s.</p>

<p>Just as Henry George's ideas spanned the political spectrum, from opposition to price regulation to socialization of land, so too did his disciples and philosophical descendants. However, throughout this process, it's important to remember that the fundamental belief George had was not in simply land value taxation, but liberal-democratic urban governance and its role in improving the lives of ordinary people. That is probably the most important takeaway from this history of Henry George.</p>

 <summary> <em>Paved Paradise</em>, Henry Grabar</summary>

<p>Henry Grabar's <em>Paved Paradise</em> is an excellent overview of the many ways that parking, quite literally, rules everything around us. From housing to transportation to the very urban form we live in, the ever longing quest to park our cars has shaped the trajectory of the entire world. And, Grabar argues, in a negative direction.</p>

<p>The story begins with a subsidized housing complex proposed in the affluent neighborhood of Solana Beach, which was to replace a parking lot. The central character of these first chapters is Ginger Hitzke, who is fighting a pyrrhic war with the city in order to try to get her project approved. The central issue? Her project does not pencil with the parking spots that she would be mandated to build by the California Coastal Commission. Oddly, despite the fact that the mandated parking would kill housing that would allow people to access the beach, the Coastal Commission, which is charged with allowing wide access to the beach, still used parking to nearly kill the project. Indeed, during the public comment for the project, Hitzke once again heard an earful from all the Solana Beach residents about the parking situation. This raises a greater question: why, exactly, are we so obsessed with parking?</p>

<p>Through stories of arguments over parking spaces turning deadly, to affordable housing projects killed on the cross of "where will people park," to bona fide diplomatic incidents over parking tickets in New York City, parking seems to be central to our world. This story stretches back almost a hundred years — in the 1920s, as Los Angeles (a city synonymous with the car) began to develop, and people in Los Angeles began to buy cars, parking, and the associated congestion that searching for parking caused, became the central issue of the time. Cars were left strewn all over the street — at this time, the parking meter was still a few years from being invented — and maintaining order in this carmageddon was nigh impossible. So, for a short amount of time, Los Angeles did the unthinkable: they banned street parking. After complaints from downtown merchants, the city brought it back, however. And, in its place, Los Angeles adopted the mandatory parking minimum.</p>

<p>Soon, parking began to define the urban form. Beloved housing styles such as the bungalow court in Los Angeles, the three-flat in Chicago, and the triple decker in Boston would be illegal to build today thanks to parking minimums. In the 1950s, as Los Angeles began to see a surge in population and demand for housing, builders began to convert 7750 square foot lots into cheap dingbat apartments — required by the parking minimums of the time for 1 per unit built — until the city increased the parking minimum to 1.5 per unit, effectively killing the form forever. Of course, this story did not merely affect the construction of apartment buildings — it changed the entire central business district.</p>

<p>Now that central cities were forced to compete with suburbs, whose cheap land made building large parking lots for cars financially viable, they thought it best to fight fire with fire — or rather, parking with parking. Cities built giant garages, and flush with money for urban renewal, sought to completely remake themselves around the car. They bulldozed block after block for parking and created grand designs for large urban expressways in an effort to woo suburbanites toward downtown. However, in the process, they ended up destroying their very city. After a certain point, after you've demolished your central city for parking lots, there's nowhere <em>to</em> go in the center city. However, cities kept their parking requirements, long after their central business districts were all but dead thanks to the stifling effect they had on development and density.</p>

<p>The central problem that cities faced was their inability to see just how valuable the land they used for parking was. The best example of this might be when Chicago sold off their parking meters for a 75 year lease — only for $1 Billion in the face of a budget crisis. However, as soon as they did, the consortium of banks and sovereign wealth funds that purchased the meters immediately increased parking rates, and making a giant return on their investment. Though it was easier to find a parking spot in Chicago now with a properly priced curb, it came at a giant opportunity cost within the city budget. All that meter revenue was no longer in public hands.</p>

<p>Grabar also chronicles the rocket to stardom of Donald Shoup — a slightly eccentric urban planner at UCLA who wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X">The High Cost of Free Parking</a>. His followers, known as "Shoupistas," started taking city governments and city planning departments by storm, demanding the three main recommendations that Shoup makes in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charging a market-clearing price for street parking.</li>
<li>Removing mandatory parking minimums.</li>
<li>Directing parking revenue into the blocks which are metered.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, parking policies have much more of an impact than the humble pricing of street parking — Grabar discusses how a change in parking is also changing the housing landscape. The rise of accessory dwelling units in southern California can be directly linked to the ease of garage conversions after parking minimums were lifted. During the coronavirus pandemic, as people needed places to socialize outside, street parking was converted into restaurant seating, contributing greatly to the ambience of streets and allowing for some respite during a time of great pain. Starting in the late 1990s, Downtown Los Angeles (the most parking-dense neighborhood in the country) saw a boom as old, abandoned office buildings were converted into new apartments, thanks to the lifting of parking requirements.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, Grabar's book is an optimistic one. We know now what the planners of the past did not — we understand the value of urban space, and understand that, if we actually see it for what it is, maybe we won't use it for so much car parking. I tend to agree; it's time to see what we can really do with our cities once they are liberated of the burden to provide so much parking.</p>

 <summary> <em>Arbitrary Lines</em>, Nolan Gray</summary>

<p>Nolan Gray is a friend of mine, but despite that, I ended up having to wait quite a bit before I was able to get my hands on a copy and read the book. However, the book did not disappoint — it is very readable, approachable, and provides both a great template for understanding one of the most impactful parts of our lives (where and how we live), and an excellent argument for abolishing zoning entirely.</p>

<p>To start, what is zoning? Zoning is, essentially, land use regulations that control the use (commercial, industrial, or residential) and density (single-family, duplex, apartment, etc.) of new buildings. Zoning also mandates setbacks from lot lines, minimum lot sizes, and minimum parking requirements. It doesn't control the demarcation of neighborhoods, nor does it control noise impacts or other externalities directly. Ostensibly this system is meant to "rationalize" land use, but Gray posits that zoning leads to segregation, car dependence, and makes us all poorer in the process.</p>

<p>How might these rules do so? Well, let's start with zoning's origin. The first zoning code was adopted in New York City in 1916, one year after T. Coleman Du Pont built the Equitable Building on Broadway in Manhattan. While the Equitable Building is unobjectionable on its face, it included 1.2 million square feet of office space, putting downward pressure on commercial rents in the area. Additionally, Fifth Avenue merchants were mad about encroachment of loft factories, not because of any perceived nuisances, but out of the belief that Eastern European and Jewish factory workers would scare off their posh clientele. These proverbial bootleggers allied with the erstwhile central planners of the Progressive Era to push for the creation of zoning.</p>

<p>However, the New York City zoning code was not the one that served as the template for modern zoning, but rather Berkeley's zoning code, which was pushed for by industrialists (who wanted to guarantee their investments wouldn't face lawsuits by irked neighbors) and racists (who didn't want Chinese laundries and a Black dance hall opening in their white neighborhoods). The Supreme Court gave its blessing to zoning in the 1926 decision in <em>Euclid v. Ambler</em>, where the Ambler realty company tried and failed to sue the city of Euclid, Ohio, when it zoned their land for industrial use. In the majority decision, Justice Sutherland called apartment buildings "mere parasites," thereby informing the primary use of zoning laws — economic segregation.</p>

<p>Zoning increases housing costs in three primary ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It reduces the supply of housing by restricting new construction directly.</li>
<li>It mandates that the housing that is produced be more expensive than it might have been otherwise.</li>
<li>It leads to investment uncertainty — in cities with extremely restrictive zoning, rezonings require a discretionary permitting process, which increases the risk of housing construction.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reductions in housing supply make us poorer by locking people out of high-powered metro areas — San Jose, for example, is home to some of the highest wage industries in the country, but because housing cost increases are even higher than the respective wage increases, there is an <em>outflow</em> out of San Jose and similar metro areas. This isn't normal — until 1980, incomes between different regions of the United States were converging due to an inflow of workers to higher wage areas, but now, moving from Orlando to San Jose doesn't pencil out.</p>

<p>In the aggregate, the inability for workers to move to where they command the highest wage yields losses measuring in the trillions of dollars (with a T). According to Hsieh and Moretti (2019), if zoning in New York, San Francisco, and San Jose was at the median American level, the average worker would make thousands of dollars more.</p>

<p>In addition to making us all poorer, zoning also leads to segregation and sprawl. Mandating single uses, single-family living, large lots, and parking not only leads to needing to drive everywhere, but the expensive housing locks out poorer African Americans and Hispanics from the highest opportunity neighborhoods. Despite measurable improvements in race relations since 1970, segregation remains stubborn as ever, thanks to zoning. Gray goes so far as to call zoning "American apartheid," for its deleterious effects on racial integration to this day.</p>

<p>The fundamental flaw of zoning as practiced by city planners in the modern day is the fatal conceit of all city planners — they cannot rationally plan every land use. Markets for land and labor are the fundamental determinants of a city's form, not what a land use planner believes is the case. The primary method of the land use planner, zoning, has led to immense costs with few, if any, benefits.</p>

<p>Gray offers some examples of moving towards a less terrible zoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing accessory dwelling units (such as in Fayetteville and California)</li>
<li>State pre-emption of zoning laws (such as California and Arkansas)</li>
<li>Uniform zoning codes (as in Japan)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Gray believes that city planners must go fully beyond zoning. If it has such great costs and so few benefits, why not abolish fully? Of course, this doesn't mean the end of city planning — planners still need to mediate conflicts, regulate externalities, and plan street networks. For those who believe that the city sans zoning would be a chaotic failure, Gray offers Houston as a prime example.</p>

<p>Houston, unlike other cities, put zoning up to a vote — and it failed all three times. In place of zoning, Houston allows neighborhoods to come together and, with a supermajority vote, implement their own land use regulations for the neighborhood. Gray believes deed restrictions are an acceptable solution for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They apply within a small portion of the city.</li>
<li>They require more thought than zoning laws, because property owners will try to maximize their values and choose land use regulations that are most acceptable to the market.</li>
<li>Deed restrictions are subject to regular review, unlike the zoning code.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Houston obviously isn't perfect — they still have height limits, parking minimums, and built large urban freeways. However, their system of land use regulation is still more geared towards mitigating real impacts, rather than blunt aesthetics or class segregation.</p>

<p>Gray knows that his proposal wouldn't solve every problem, but he believes it is a necessary move towards a more equitable, sustainable, and affordable city, and I tend to agree. Hopefully policymakers will see the light soon enough.</p>

 <summary><em>Remaking the American Dream</em>, Vinit Mukhija</summary>

<p>I thought this book was very interesting because it fused two of my favorite ideas: zoning and emergent order. Mukhija weaves various scholars' work, including his own, to paint a fascinating picture of Los Angeles as a city that, while on its surface a single-family home paradise, is in actuality a hotbed of emergent development patterns. A lot of Mukhija's work is centered around accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, and specifically the unpermitted kind.</p>

<p>What's notable about Mukhija is that, while based out of Los Angeles, he is also a scholar of Mumbai. Mumbai, like Los Angeles, has a very strict land use regime (where floor area is restricted to 1.33 times the area of the lot), and as a result, much of the urban development in Mumbai has been through slum housing. Mukhija draws heavy parallels between the development of slum housing more generally and the proliferation of unpermitted ADUs.</p>

<p>One of Mukhija's main points of emphasis is that in responding to the proliferation of informal housing, governments need to take a two-pronged approach of both deregulation and financial support and guidance. Mukhija is more bullish on the prospects of local action than I am, but he does provide evidence to back up his beliefs. For example, in Vancouver, he notes that attached ADUs (converted garages/basements) are provided a lower height allowance due to the prevalence of the "Vancouver Special," wherein a single-family house would have a 6'6" tall basement that was often converted to a dwelling unit.</p>

<p>I think my main point of contention with the central thrust of the book is my general distrust of local governments and "public input" mechanisms in being able to implement broadly-accessible and equitable reforms. Mukhija is a big proponent of using public discussion to guide policy in the book, and I'm not sure that's a very effective idea — many of the best policies come about through observation of informality, but not through public discussion/community input style events. Informal housing provides an opportunity to see where the market is heading — and allows policymakers to get ahead of the market. It doesn't really matter what the community input is on such a proposal, because after a certain point, the market has spoken for itself.</p>

<p>However, despite that main flaw I saw in it, <em>Remaking the American Dream</em> is an excellent book that serves a valuable entry into the discourse. I believe its call to action is best summarized as "let informality guide your policymaking."</p>
