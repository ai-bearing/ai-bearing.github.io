I'm going to be using this place to host the books I read over summer, as well as including some reviews/overviews. Enjoy!

## Arbitrary Lines
### Nolan Gray

## Remaking the American Dream
### Vinit Mukhija

I thought this book was very interesting because it fused two of my favorite ideas: zoning and emergent order. Mukhija weaves various scholars' work, including his own, to paint a fascinating picture of Los Angeles as a city that, while on its surface a single-family home paradise, is in actuality a hotbed of emergent development patterns. A lot of Mukhija's work is centered around accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, and specifically the unpermitted kind.

What's notable about Mukhija is that, while based out of Los Angeles, he is also a scholar of Mumbai. Mumbai, like Los Angeles, has a very strict land use regime (where floor area is restricted to 1.33 times the area of the lot), and as a result, much of the urban development in Mumbai has been through slum housing. Mukhija draws heavy parallels between the development of slum housing more generally and the proliferation of unpermitted ADUs.

One of Mukhija's main points of emphasis is that in responding to the proliferation of informal housing, governments need to take a two-pronged approach of both deregulation and financial support and guidance. Mukhija is more bullish on the prospects of local action than I am, but he does provide evidence to back up his beliefs. For example, in Vancouver, he notes that attached ADUs (converted garages/basements) are provided a lower height allowance due to the prevalence of the "Vancouver Special," wherein a single-family house would have a 6'6" tall basement that was often converted to a dwelling unit.

I think my main point of contention with the central thrust of the book is my general distrust of local governments and "public input" mechanisms in being able to implement broadly-accessible and equitable reforms. Mukhija is a big proponent of using public discussion to guide policy in the book, and I'm not sure that's a very effective idea — many of the best policies come about through observation of informality, but not through public discussion/community input style events. Informal housing provides an opportunity to see where the market is heading — and allows policymakers to get ahead of the market. It doesn't really matter what the community input is on such a proposal, because after a certain point, the market has spoken for itself.

However, despite that main flaw I saw in it, *Remaking the American Dream* is an excellent book that serves a valuable entry into the discourse. I believe its call to action is best summarized as "let informality guide your policymaking."
