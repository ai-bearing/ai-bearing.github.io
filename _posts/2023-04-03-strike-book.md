I'm going to be using this place to store my outline for a reading assignment for one of my classes, where I'm reading *The Strike that Changed New York*, about the Ocean Hill-Brownsville crisis.

## Introduction
- Ocean Hill-Brownsville district established as an experiment in "community control" of school district, exercised much leeway.
- Fred Nauman, schoolteacher and union member, locked in struggle. Was to be fired.
- Rhody McCoy, administrator, fired Nauman and 18 other white teachers.

> White teachers did not want to teach in black schools. They transferred out to the "better" white schools as soon as they fulfilled the five year service requirement.

- Premise for OH-Bv project was that white educational establishment had failed in this regard. Union dealt with many issues in this regard.

> The union had objected to the board's choice for principals in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville schools. It had fought curriculum change. It had tried to stop the local board from controlling its own finances. And it had refused to allow the local board to choose its own teaching personnel.

- OH-Bv controversy begins with the termination letter to Fred Nauman.

> The differences between blacks and whites over these questions that surfaced at Ocean Hill–Brownsville were not the work of unscrupulous demagogues or racial racketeers: they were too deep-seated and heartfelt for this. They would affect New York’s social and class relations, electoral alignments, fiscal policies, labor negotiations, and political culture for decades to come. Indeed, they echo in the life of the city today. The idea that blacks and whites view the same circumstances and events in different ways is now something of a commonplace. Ocean Hill–Brownsville’s historical significance for New York lies in the fact that this perceptual gulf first came into the open there, shaking a city that prided itself on its tolerance, open-mindedness, and humane liberalism.

- Original political conflict was between Jews and Catholics, and after OH-Bv, became between "White" and "Black," and Jews became associated with whiteness.

> The road leading to Rhody McCoy’s letter to Fred Nauman began with the creation of these racial worlds, and these two New Yorks.

## Chapter 1: Two New Yorks
One Point: The demographic and socioeconomic changes in New York led to, simultaneously, intense segregation and strengthening labor-government relations. These factors provide the backdrop for the Ocean Hill-Brownsville controversy.

> In a typical graduating class, only 2 percent went on to one of the city’s specialized high schools, which required applicants to pass written entrance examinations and served as feeders to major universities and the city colleges.

> By the mid-1960s, then, Ocean Hill–Brownsville symbolized the isolation of dozens of poor black communities throughout New York City: geographically segregated, economically stagnant, politically weak, and educationally marginalized. 

> The crucial role education would play as a means of advancement — as a commodity — in the city’s new economy was lost on neither blacks nor whites. Black leaders understood that education provided the only opportunity for their people to break out of their isolation in city life. Middle-class whites viewed it as the key element in their own enhanced status.

## Chapter 2: The Rise of "Community"
(Notetaker's commentary: I am very interested in this idea and its controversies)
One Point: "Community" has undergone a full circle transition from being about maintaining segregation to the era of Ocean Hill-Brownsville community control (among leftists), back to the conservative fight against busing and school integration.

> But Linda Brown had asked only to attend her neighborhood school in Topeka; de facto residential segregation in New York made the achievement of Brown’s objectives immensely more complicated. The idea that black children—no matter where they actually lived—needed to attend school with white children in order to receive equal educational opportunity, became the central tenet of civil rights activists in New York, including [Kenneth] Clark himself, a City College professor.

> [Milton Galamison] demanded that blacks and whites be placed in physical proximity to each other, both in the city’s schools, and—just as important in view of the prevalent system of "tracking" that separated out "slow" black pupils—in the classrooms themselves. Ultimately, he wished to see the ratio of blacks to whites in each of New York’s individual school districts correspond to that in the city school system as a whole.

> Other PAT-ers cited economic concerns, worrying aloud about the consequences of a large influx of black children into their schools: "Eight years ago, we paid $12,000 for this house. We scraped together every penny we had… My husband and me, we worked hard to get it and it’s all we have. And now if the Negroes start coming, it won’t be worth a cent."

> New York’s school integration activists embraced community control, in large measure, because of PAT’s success with it. During PAT’s heyday between 1963 and 1965, these activists had been forced by practical necessity to rely on the force of centralized authority—the Board of Education—to realize their goals.

> The idea of "community" — black community — was a perfect vehicle to express both disgust with white New York and faith in the political, economic, and cultural regeneration of black New York. But the shift from integration to "community" carried with it a potential conundrum for blacks and progressive whites, one whose ironies appeared lost on Galamison, EQUAL, and other critics of PAT and the "neighborhood school."

## Chapter 3: "White" Values, "Black" Values
One Point: Disillusionment with the "liberal" or "moderate" approach toward civil rights led to the emergence of a contingent focused on bringing African-American community self-determination and control as opposed to assimilation into white society. This coincided with the assimilation of Jews into whiteness, as the dividing lines in NYC switched from Jews vs. Catholics to White vs. Black.

> This UFT-endorsed "moderate" pluralism would be exemplified during the Ocean Hill–Brownsville crisis itself by a social studies lesson given at JHS 271 by a white teacher, R. J. Papaleo—one that was disrupted by African-American Teachers Association leader Leslie Campbell. The plan for the lesson asked: "How is America divided on the question of civil rights?" It divided a hypothetical "American Highway" into three lanes—two narrow ones for left- and right-wing "extremists," and a wide "center lane." Discussion questions included "What happens to America when either the right or left lane becomes more crowded?," and "Why is the key to peace and happiness found in observing moderation in things?"

> The culture of the white majority of the UFT in the 1960s was, to a large degree, a reflection of that of the white middle class in New York City as a whole. Both were built around conceptions of individualism, marketplace competition, and objective merit, a critical view of lower-class black cultural expressions, and a moderate pluralism featuring a cautious endorsement of group distinctiveness bounded by a common cultural framework.

> As early as 1963, Kenneth Clark was taking the culture of poverty, and the related concept of cultural deprivation, to task. There were no "culturally deprived" children, he wrote, only "children who are being denied their rights as human beings... deliberately and chronically victimized by the larger societyi n general and by educational institutions, specifically."

> Even successful black students, [Charles Hamilton] argued, were "permanently crippled, psychologically, while at the same time measuring up to criteria others have decided are the major determinants for 'achievement.'" He called for the replacement of a white middle-class educational structure based "solely on the acquisition of verbal skills" by one based on black "normative values," which he defined as "color consciousness, not color-blindness, group cohesion, not individualism [and] respect for Afro-American culture, not assumption of white, western cultural superiority."

> Thus, beginning in the mid-1960s, black intellectuals in New York, aided by a small but influential group of sympathetic whites, sought to link a series of attributes — competition, individualism, and materialism — specifically to the white middle class. In the context of the New York City public education system and the fight for community control, black activists and their white allies associated these same attributes, which they viewed as shallow and fraudulent, with white UFT teachers.

## Chapter 4: The Community Control Experiment

One Point: After decentralization, tensions between the UFT and Rhody McCoy, who was in charge of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville experiment, increased, with many of these tensions coming about through the actions of schoolchildren.

## Chapter 5: The Strikes
One Point: Rhody McCoy, after pretextually dismissing Fred Nauman and 18 other white staff from Ocean Hill-Brownsville schools, tries to come up with post hoc reasons for their dismissal, while UFT leader Albert Shanker starts organizing a strike.

## Chapter 6: The Third Strike and Beyond
One Point: Ocean Hill-Brownsville led to a realignment away from class and Jewish-Catholic divisions towards race and Black-White divisions. Afterwards, with "decentralization" as opposed to community control, the UFT retained its tight grip on the school system in New York.

> New York, as Ocean Hill–Brownsville had shown so dramatically, was not so much a city of bosses and workers as it was one of blacks and whites.

> Despite the absorption by the system as a whole of much of the philosophical underpinnings of the Ocean Hill–Brownsville experiment, achievement levels for black public school students, as measured both by standardized test scores and by classroom performance, declined throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

## Chapter 7: Culture War
One Point: The emergence of a divide between African American Teachers (under the ATA) and the UFT went deeper than simple union disputes, but rather to the core of the idea between the "culture of poverty" and the idea that rebellion against white societal expectations was necessary for the advancement of the black poor.

## Chapter 8: After the Crisis
One Point: In a cruel (and expected) twist of fate, the advocates of community control among black communities had their cause co-opted by middle class and affluent whites, especially rising after decentralization in the 1960s and 70s. This culminated in the rise of Ed Koch and the effective end of liberal, pluralist New York in favor of racial factionalism.

> Perhaps the most important service white New Yorkers can perform for the city and for themselves is to allow blacks to carve out their own definition of what it means to be black and middle-class. Whites must accept the possibility that this definition will be different, perhaps substantially so, from theirs.

> It is also unrealistic for both blacks and whites to put their faith, as some contemporary critics, activists, and historians appear to do, in the disappearance of the category of "whiteness" itself as a solution to the city’s and the nation’s racial problems.

## Chapter 9: Ocean Hill-Brownsville, New York, America
One Point: Ocean Hill-Brownsville was only one example of the greater shift going on in broader American culture — whites and blacks realized that they lived in stark contrast, and even though there was nominal equality before the law, realistically there was not much.
