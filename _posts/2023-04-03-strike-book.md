I'm going to be using this place to store my outline for a reading assignment for one of my classes, where I'm reading *The Strike that Changed New York*, about the Ocean Hill-Brownsville crisis.

## Introduction
- Ocean Hill-Brownsville district established as an experiment in "community control" of school district, exercised much leeway.
- Fred Nauman, schoolteacher and union member, locked in struggle. Was to be fired.
- Rhody McCoy, administrator, fired Nauman and 18 other white teachers.

> White teachers did not want to teach in black schools. They transferred out to the "better" white schools as soon as they fulfilled the five year service requirement.

- Premise for OH-Bv project was that white educational establishment had failed in this regard. Union dealt with many issues in this regard.

> The union had objected to the board's choice for principals in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville schools. It had fought curriculum change. It had tried to stop the local board from controlling its own finances. And it had refused to allow the local board to choose its own teaching personnel.

- OH-Bv controversy begins with the termination letter to Fred Nauman.

> The differences between blacks and whites over these questions that surfaced at Ocean Hill–Brownsville were not the work of unscrupulous demagogues or racial racketeers: they were too deep-seated and heartfelt for this. They would affect New York’s social and class relations, electoral alignments, fiscal policies, labor negotiations, and political culture for decades to come. Indeed, they echo in the life of the city today. The idea that blacks and whites view the same circumstances and events in different ways is now something of a commonplace. Ocean Hill–Brownsville’s historical significance for New York lies in the fact that this perceptual gulf first came into the open there, shaking a city that prided itself on its tolerance, open-mindedness, and humane liberalism.

- Original political conflict was between Jews and Catholics, and after OH-Bv, became between "White" and "Black," and Jews became associated with whiteness.

> The road leading to Rhody McCoy’s letter to Fred Nauman began with the creation of these racial worlds, and these two New Yorks.

## Chapter 1: Two New Yorks
One Point: The demographic and socioeconomic changes in New York led to, simultaneously, intense segregation and strengthening labor-government relations. These factors provide the backdrop for the Ocean Hill-Brownsville controversy.

> In a typical graduating class, only 2 percent went on to one of the city’s specialized high schools, which required applicants to pass written entrance examinations and served as feeders to major universities and the city colleges.

> By the mid-1960s, then, Ocean Hill–Brownsville symbolized the isolation of dozens of poor black communities throughout New York City: geographically segregated, economically stagnant, politically weak, and educationally marginalized. 

> The crucial role education would play as a means of advancement — as a commodity — in the city’s new economy was lost on neither blacks nor whites. Black leaders understood that education provided the only opportunity for their people to break out of their isolation in city life. Middle-class whites viewed it as the key element in their own enhanced status.

## Chapter 2: The Rise of "Community"
(Notetaker's commentary: I am very interested in this idea and its controversies)
One Point: "Community" has undergone a full circle transition from being about maintaining segregation to the era of Ocean Hill-Brownsville community control (among leftists), back to the conservative fight against busing and school integration.

> But Linda Brown had asked only to attend her neighborhood school in Topeka; de facto residential segregation in New York made the achievement of Brown’s objectives immensely more complicated. The idea that black children—no matter where they actually lived—needed to attend school with white children in order to receive equal edu- cational opportunity, became the central tenet of civil rights activists in New York, including [Kenneth] Clark himself, a City College professor.

> [Milton Galamison] demanded that blacks and whites be placed in physical prox- imity to each other, both in the city’s schools, and—just as important in view of the prevalent system of "tracking" that separated out "slow" black pupils—in the classrooms themselves. Ultimately, he wished to see the ratio of blacks to whites in each of New York’s individual school districts correspond to that in the city school system as a whole.

> Other PAT-ers cited economic concerns, worrying aloud about the consequences of a large influx of black children into their schools: "Eight years ago, we paid $12,000 for this house. We scraped together every penny we had… My husband and me, we worked hard to get it and it’s all we have. And now if the Negroes start coming, it won’t be worth a cent."

> New York’s school integration activists embraced community control, in large measure, because of PAT’s success with it. During PAT’s heyday between 1963 and 1965, these activists had been forced by practical necessity to rely on the force of centralized authority—the Board of Education—to realize their goals.

> The idea of "community" — black community — was a perfect vehicle to express both disgust with white New York and faith in the political, economic, and cultural regeneration of black New York. But the shift from integration to "community" carried with it a potential conundrum for blacks and progressive whites, one whose ironies appeared lost on Galamison, EQUAL, and other critics of PAT and the "neighborhood school."
