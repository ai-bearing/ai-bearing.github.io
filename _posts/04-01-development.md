Okay so I'm going to be keeping my various notes on different sources that I'm going to be using for an upcoming paper on the political economy of development in Latin America, including quotes and findings and whatnot.

## Import Substitution
[Hirschman, 1968](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1882243.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Aaf4b238383811bbc7d361a60cacb4600&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=):

Page 4:
> As incomes and markets expand... and some thresholds at which domestic production becomes profitable are crossed, industries come into being without the need of external shocks or government intervention.

Page 5:
> Over the past two decades import-substituting industrialization has... no longer been exclusively a matter of natural market forces reacting to either gradual growth of income or to cataclysmic events, such as wars or depressions. It has been undertaken in many countries as a matter of deliberate development policy, carried out no longer just by means of protective duties, but through a wide array of credit and fiscal policy devices...

> It is useful to keep in mind these distinct origins of ISI — wars, balance-of-payments difficulties, growth of the domestic market (as a result of export growth) and official development policy — in focusing on the distinctive characteristics of the process.

Page 13:
> Three principal accusations have been leveled against the industrialization process as it appeared in Latin America:
>> 1) Import-substituting industrialization is apt to get "stuck" after its first successes, due to the "exhaustion of easy import substitution opportunities"; it leaves the economy with a few relatively high-cost industrial establishments and with a far more vulnerable balance of payments since imports consist now of semifinished materials, spare parts and machinery indispensably required for maintaining and increasing production and employment.
>> 2) Import-substituting industry is affected by seemingly congenital inability to move into export markets.
>> 3) The new industries are making an inadequate contribution to the solution of the unemployment problem.
