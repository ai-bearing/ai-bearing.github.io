It's April 17, which we can probably classify as the beginning of the end of the school year. After this week, it's only papers, finals, and graduation parties left, and soon I'll be back in the Bay Area. I guess this is a good a time as any to reflect on things I've done.

Relatively speaking, I think this was a more productive year than last. I definitely was able to settle into more of a rhythm in my relation to work, exercise, and productivity. I think the following might be able to be classified as "accomplishments," more or less:

- Created this website, then recreated it.
- Achieved an A in Intermediate Micro, and generally speaking kept my GPA above 3.9, which is SCL at graduation.
- Increased my 1 rep max bench from 85 to 145, my multi-rep squat from 95 to 185, and my multi-rep deadlift from 135 to 185.
- Avoided precipitous weight gain like I dealt with last semester, largely kept to a relatively stable intermittent fasting schedule.
- Read a few books, expanded my horizons a little more.
- Wrote 12 articles for *The Occidental*, mostly opinion pieces but I did successfully write a few reported stories that only needed minor edits.
- Obtained an editor spot for the paper, starting next semester.
- Got lunch with the former mayor of Culver City.

Of course, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. I am definitely not particularly social (though probably more social now than I was in the previous year), and my mental health has been difficult, to say the least. I didn't get into any REUs (very unfortunately), which was quite a disappointment, and I probably could have done more reported stories for the college, were I not sick and tired of having to wrangle sources.

However, upon this reflection, I think it's fair to say that my lot has somewhat improved compared to how I was last year. At the beginning of freshman year, I was very unathletic, unfamiliar with lifting weights, not even sure I wanted to do a math major, and I didn't really write much of anything. Over this year, I think I've grown somewhat out of my shell, and I've learned to try more things and accept failure.

With the remaining time, I'm hoping to finish pretty strong â€” A's in my math and econ classes (though I'm probably going to drop to a minor to accommodate more math classes), finish the various papers and presentations, and get Dean's List again. Also, attend the math and newspaper end-of-year parties, which are destined to be pretty fun.
