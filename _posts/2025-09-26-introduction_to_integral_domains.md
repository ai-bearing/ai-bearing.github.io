In algebra, one of the central structures is that of the [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)) â€” specifically here, we focus on unital, commutative rings (i.e., those with commutative multiplication and a multiplicative identity) that admit no zero-divisors. These are known as integral domains, and there are a few major ones that we will focus on.

## Euclidean Domains
From grade school, we know that we can divide two integers together with remainder --- i.e., if $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, then there are unique $q$ and $r$ such that $ a = qb + r,$ where $r = 0$ or $|r| < b$.
