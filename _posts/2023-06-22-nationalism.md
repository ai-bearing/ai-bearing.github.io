The nationalist think tank American Compass recently released a set of policy briefs known as "Reimagining American Capitalism," in which they make a number of pretty bad recommendations. However, there is one that is so economically illiterate, so disastrous in nature, that I figured I wanted to write about how currency exchanges work in response. They [state](https://americancompass.org/policy-brief-the-global-tariff/):
> America imports massively more than it exports, leaving us deeply indebted to our trading partners.
> 
> Rather than exchange American goods for foreign goods, we import on credit, sending back IOUs and ownership of our economy, which future generations will pay for.
> 
> In the process, we allow the erosion of American industry and innovation, the decline of manufacturing employment, and the collapse of communities.

Aside from the repugnance of assuming that foreigners desire ill for the economy (they are quite literally invested in its success), the fact of the matter is that, in the United States, the balance of trade is determined not by domestic demand for goods and services, but by *foreign* demand for *dollars.* In the balance of payments, a current account deficit is equal and opposite to the capital account surplus. If Chinese, Japanese, and Korean companies are willing to invest in the United States (for which they need dollars), and American consumers desire goods and services (for which they pay in dollars), then American consumers will buy goods and services to satisfy the demand on the part of foreigners for dollars.

Suppose we implement a global tariff (that is, a uniform import duty on all goods and services). This means the cost to consumers of these goods and services rises, meaning they spend fewer dollars. However, because the dollar is a free-floating currency, and the United States does not have major capital controls, and, presumably, foreigners don't have any less willingness to invest in the American economy (assuming economic growth isn't held back). So, since the supply of dollars is lower, the price of the dollars in foreign currency rises â€” and the dollar becomes stronger (meaning Americans are able to afford more imports). Because dollars are more expensive in foreign currency, this also means exports are expensive abroad. Soon, we find out that the trade deficit hasn't changed much at all.

This is a good theoretical model, but does it hold up in real life? Yes. The IMF [finds](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/01/15/Macroeconomic-Consequences-of-Tariffs-46469) that the macroeconomic consequences of tariffs yields:
> ...more unemployment, higher inequality, and real exchange rate appreciation, but only small effects on the trade balance.

The only thing that comes as a result of this global tariff isn't a reduction in the trade deficit, nor is it a bolstering of domestic industry, but simply making the entire populace poorer (as they have to spend more for their imports). When the currency is free-floating and the current account deficit is high, that means that the capital account surplus is high, indicating a high confidence on the part of foreign investors, not a "hollowing out" of domestic investment.
