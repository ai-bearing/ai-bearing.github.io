Disaster has struck! Not even a week into my exercise routine, it turns out I have a few major problems that have led me to truncate and refocus.
- First of all, my ankle mobility problems were much worse than previously thought, and their effects propagated through my lower leg. After the first Frisbee practice, my knee was so messed up that the day after, I needed to do a ton of stretching to allow for a moderately reasonable range of motion on my knee. I ended up quitting Frisbee, and I will probably end up not doing any kind of heavy-impact cardio exercise.
- Because of the aforementioned ankle problems, I am unable to do proper squats, and my desire to avoid isolation exercises has left me with needing a new way to exercise my quadriceps. I might try doing sumo deadlifts in addition to regular deadlifts.
- I have also found that lifting makes my sleep the following night much better, extremely helpful considering that my sleep schedule is often lackluster due to having early classes and spending late nights studying. I'm moving towards lifting 5 days a week, spending less time doing cardio.
- However, I still need to do _some_ cardio, so I will probably start using the elliptical machine on the weekends, or doing something else.

Overall, I think there are enough substantial problems in my ankle mobility complex, alongside a very large workload, that have led to me needing to spend less time doing intensive cardio. This might hurt or help me depending on recovery benefit vs. detraining cost, but I think my right ankle is messed up enough that I need to do this before I'm in a knee brace. Hopefully it all works out.
