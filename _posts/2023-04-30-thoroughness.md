title: "Why Thoroughness and State Capacity Matter: Measure ULA in Los Angeles"

In 2022, Los Angeles passed [Measure ULA](https://www.altusgroup.com/insights/measure-ula-latest-tax-increase-to-transfer-taxes-california/), a transfer tax aimed at funding new subsidized housing and other measures to alleviate the housing shortage in Los Angeles. Nicknamed the "mansion tax," it would charge 5% on real property transfers valued above $5M, and 5.5% on transfers valued above $10M. Seems great, right?

Well, no. It is a very poorly designed tax that will not substantively alleviate the shortage, and also comes with its own set of problems that will result in the city having a worse position after the tax than before. More than anything, ULA is the perfect example of why thoroughness and state capacity are vital for crafting good policy.

## The Tax Base

First of all, despite its name, the "mansion tax" will not actually fall on mansions, it will primarily fall on apartment buildings and offices within the "merchant builder" category — that is, developers that buy parcels, build an apartment building, then sell to a property manager for maintenance.

Despite what some people may believe, merchant builders run on very thin margins. Most of these businesses make about 3–5% return once lenders and equity investors are paid, and development is a business with lots of risk. Without reforming any land use or permitting practices, the tax primarily reduces the viability of the business model.

Did the crafters of the measure know this? I suspect not. Additionally, they did not implement a marginal rate structure (so a building worth $4.9M would pay a 1.1% tax rate, while a building worth $5.1M would pay a 5% tax rate *on the full value*). It doesn't even include an exemption for new multifamily construction.

## The Crafters

The crafters of ULA were primarily two groups:
- ACT-LA, a member of the local nonprofit industrial complex
- The Los Angeles/Orange County Building Trades

These groups are somewhat similar, with some differing interests here or there, but more importantly, neither of them are the city government. Of course, one might think that the city government lacks the will to pass such an initiative, which is why it went through these interest groups, but that's not really true.

Multiple elected officials, such as Nithya Raman and Mike Bonin, supported ULA and campaigned for it. Afterward, even with Bonin's departure, there was a wave of candidates that supported ULA who entered office. This was not a problem of lack of candidates in government to implement such policy, but rather a lack of capacity to write such an initiative within LA city government.

Culver City passed a [transfer tax](https://www.culvercity.org/Services/Make-a-Payment/Real-Property-Transfer-Tax) in 2020 to supplement the county's rate. It was written by the government, through a transparent and open process that included analysis of the finances of such a tax so as to minimize the negative effects on housing construction.

ULA was not written through this public process. No merchant builder developers were consulted during the process, and the only analysis of the potential effects was written primarily to bolster the case for such a tax, without a thorough analysis of the effects on development.

This isn't to say that transfer taxes are bad — they primarily fall on land values and, when uniform and proper, are probably second best alongside property taxes to land value taxes — but that actual proper transfer tax design is paramount.

The incentives of the crafters, however, do not lend themselves to good transfer tax design and the state capacity necessary to make it happen:
- Nonprofits such as ACT-LA exist within the liminal space between the private and public sector, thriving when the public sector has high revenues but low capacity to implement policies on its own.
- The Building Trades are better able to extract concessions — regardless of whether an abundant housing regime would be better for their membership — when development is restricted.

## The Philosophy

Personally, I believe the government should be able to do things. Not through nonprofits, not via implementing onerous restrictions and asking for "concessions" to provide relief. I think that, if the government so desires to go into the housing construction and maintenance business, it should be able to do that without going through the nonprofit sector.

Crucially, when it does so, it should have the capacity to do so without having to go through a million different interest groups to satisfy its goal. However, the way that ULA has gone through, the crafters of the measure don't believe that ideas such as "viability" and "execution" are important, because they are not in the business of governing, but in the business of extraction from the government.

I hope ULA gets fixed, some way or another. The sloppiness within the measure is something that can be ameliorated, but the deeper problems surrounding a lack of policy thoroughness and state capacity within LA remains.
