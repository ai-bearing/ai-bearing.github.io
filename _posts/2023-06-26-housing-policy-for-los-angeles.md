In Spring of 2023, for my education policy class, I wrote a proposal focused on housing policy (specifically, advocating for large-scale zoning reform to help improve educational outcomes). I figured I want to expand on the proposal here, and explain more generally why I believe housing is such an important part of the economy.

## Why care about housing?

Everyone needs a place to live — and, in the modern economy, where one lives determines one's prospects. When economically productive places close off their housing production, this reduces the wealth of the entire economy, as workers who would be able to work in an economically productive location are unable to do so because of restricted housing supply.

The economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti [quantified](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fmac.20170388) the effects of "spatial misallocation" as a result of the housing market on the broader macroeconomy, and found that these costs ran into the thousands of dollars per person per year. Allowing a modest amount of housing (specifically, making it easier to build housing) in pricey metropolitan areas would yield the equivalent of at least an $8,000 raise for the average worker, with the benefits tilted toward the lower end. Basically, zoning liberalization would greatly increase the standard of living *even without accounting for the effects on housing costs*.

In Los Angeles, there is a common belief that the high price of housing is not a problem, but merely homelessness. This is asking the wrong question — some people who are homeless have mental health issues or drug addiction, but all people who are homeless cannot afford housing. Much homelessness is transient — that is, people are homeless for a short period of time (perhaps in between jobs), often living with friends or family. Homelessness becomes chronic when housing costs are so high that it is essentially impossible for anyone who loses their apartment to get a new one.

The housing situation in Los Angeles is bleak, to say the least. Checking the census data from [Neighborhood Data for Social Change](https://map.myneighborhooddata.org), we can see that approximately 30% of renting households in Los Angeles County are *severely* rent-burdened (that is, paying over 50% of income on rent and utilities). Over half of all renting households are cost-burdened (spending more than 30% of income on rent). About 11% of households are overcrowded, but this proportion jumps to over 30% in Westlake and Pico-Union.

Importantly, income-restricted subsidized housing (called Affordable Housing in policy discussions) *will not solve this problem.* Household overcrowding and rent burden are elevated specifically among immigrant noncitizens — who are often ineligible (or unable to access) subsidies for housing. The obscene housing costs are obscene *market rate* housing costs — and thus, must be solved by conscious policy to bring down the cost of private, market rate housing.

## Why is housing so expensive?

The reason housing is expensive in Los Angeles is not "landlord greed," nor is it a lack of rent controls. Los Angeles has rent stabilization on approximately 80% of the units in the city, but rents are higher in Los Angeles than in Seattle, where rent stabilization is banned statewide. Similarly, it is not as if sapphire-blue Los Angeles has more "landlord greed" than the politically split city of Houston. There's something else going on here.

The reason housing in Los Angeles is expensive is that there is a severe shortage. There isn't any conspiracy to hold units "off the market," it's not that landlords are more greedy in Los Angeles, it's just that there is not enough housing for the demand to live in the city. The shortage has been in place since the 1970s, and was engineered as such.

Greg Morrow [found](https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/programs/housing/housing-supply/zoning/) that the capacity for new housing in Los Angeles fell by almost 60% between 1960 and 1980, through the process of downzoning (where plots with high allowed development potential had their development potential greatly reduced). Homeowners and other "slow growthers," such as hillside residents, lobbied the government to reduce housing construction for the purpose of stopping "overdevelopment." Homeowners associations in Hancock Park and Miracle Mile designated their generic suburban sprawl as "historic" for the purpose of stopping development along the metro line, and these neighborhood associations implemented strict zoning codes to stop new housing that would serve poor and middle class people.

After these decades of downzoning, Los Angeles ended up with a system of byzantine rules, discretion, and systems that were so out of place that one wondered why the city bothered with their system in the first place. In many parcels even to this day, the zoning code and general plan are different — and, oftentimes, *neither* set of rules would allow the existing use on the parcel. Whenever a developer approaches the city council and applies for permits, this means they have to get a zoning change, general plan amendment, or both — which are controlled by the city council.

And thus, the stories of [Jose Huizar](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/former-los-angeles-city-politician-jose-huizar-pleads-guilty-racketeering-conspiracy) and [Mitchell Englander](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/former-la-city-councilman-mitch-englander-ordered-serve-14-months-federal-prison) emerge. Opponents of corruption blame developers for bribing the city councilmembers, but more often than not, it is the city councilmembers who shake down developers in exchange for approvals. This is given the euphemism of "negotiations" and "community benefits," but this is plainly what it is. Housing, especially in a shortage, is a community benefit, and does not need to go through a special discretionary process to be good for the surrounding populace.

Of course, we can go further and examine the history and [source](https://blog.avinashiyer.xyz/book_reviews#arbitrary-lines) of zoning regulations. However, even if their history wasn't full of racism and classism, it is still eminently clear that the current system of zoning laws in Los Angeles is the source of many of the current problems the city faces today. Homelessness, high cost of living, and insufficient transportation infrastructure can all be rooted back to the high cost of housing. But it's not just these areas; it's also education (and specifically, a lack of resources for poor families exacerbated by high housing costs). There is no solution to the multiple, intertwining crises that face Los Angeles today without bringing down the high cost of housing.

## How to make housing inexpensive again

Los Angeles wasn't always fated to the position it is currently in. After all, Neil Diamond once [sang](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neildiamond/iamisaid.html) that Los Angeles was where "the palm trees grow and the rents are low," and the promise of low rents and good weather was what drew many to the city in the first place. Los Angeles got into the mess it is currently in due to conscious policy decisions — and it is not out of the realm of possibility to demand different, better ones.

To start, Los Angeles should repeal Proposition U, a 1986 measure pushed by the notorious anti-growth city councilmember Zev Yaroslavsky. Proposition U restricted floor space in commercial zones severely, with floor area ratios of 1.5 on average (that is, one can only build about 1–3 stories of housing per lot, more or less). This is just a start, however — the housing shortage did not start with Proposition U, and it will not end by repealing Proposition U.

The zoning laws of Los Angeles specify, more or less, four different features of a building:
- Building use
- Building size
- Number of units
- Number of parking spaces

Architects are basically forced to design around these four requirements, which severely limits their creative freedom — and thus, the artistic styling (simple or not) of the buildings of the city. Importantly, layering on a design code on top of these four primary requirements will *not* create more beautiful architecture.

If you are concerned about the beauty or style of the residential architecture of the city, maintaining this straitjacket is detrimental to your goals. Guaranteeing regulatory certainty — i.e., as long as your housing project does not cause large externalities and conforms to the building code,it should be allowed by-right — will yield greater architectural freedom than the current system.

Creating a system that guarantees abundance and certainty of housing construction will not only yield greater architectural variety (and thus, beauty), but will tamp down on rents. Contrary to certain beliefs expounded by [city councilmembers](https://blog.avinashiyer.xyz/posts/affordability.html), building lots and lots of housing in a dense urban area *will* make housing cheaper for all, especially benefitting the very poor who are currently locked out of the housing market if they are ineligible for or unable to get a housing subsidy.

Ideally, in a perfect world, the city would wholesale abolish restrictions on buildings falling under the aforementioned four zoning law categories, but since that is probably not politically feasible right now, I would recommend prioritizing the following:
- Abolishing minimum parking requirements: Parking requirements [are the source](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/books/review/paved-paradise-henry-grabar.html) of much angst within Los Angeles's built environment, and were some of the first urban land use regulations to be tightened, with great associated costs. Popular housing types like the bungalow court and dingbat, and similar lot-by-lot redevelopments, are impossible to build under the current parking code.
- Abolishing density caps: Floor space maximums (known as "floor area ratio" or FAR) severely restrict the ability for developers to provide larger apartments or taller buildings on any given plot of land, and as a result, unduly restrict the size of apartment buildings and reduces supply of housing as a result.
- Abolishing Historic Preservation Overlay Zones: The Historic Preservation Overlay Zone is [primarily used](https://theoccidentalnews.com/opinions/2022/09/28/opinion-historical-preservation-laws-betray-our-past-and-sell-out-our-future-to-satisfy-a-few-in-the-present/2906833) to assist low-density, exclusive neighborhoods from welcoming their fair share of new residents, especially in transit-rich, walkable areas such as Highland Park/Garvanza and Miracle Mile. In order to add significantly to the housing supply, maintaining these "historic" zones cannot stand.

Of course, these three specific, actionable items are not all that is needed to make Los Angeles affordable. Building code reforms, permitting reforms, and reigning in abuse of environmental and other statues are all necessary steps to increasing housing supply, and expanding access to housing vouchers is what will be ultimately necessary to bring homelessness down to zero. But, without these steps, Los Angeles will steep further into transit death spirals, spiking homelessness, and unaffordable housing.
