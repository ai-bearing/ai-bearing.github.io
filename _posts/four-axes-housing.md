I like to imagine the way people choose their housing based on four "axes," or sets of preferences they are trying to optimize around. I think it would be useful for other people (especially people with influence) to adopt this mode of examination, and use it to guide the typologies of housing that should be built in their city or what housing types should have their permitting regulatory burden lifted.

The four axes are as follows:
- Location (i.e., center city vs. suburb, near to public transport vs. far away from it, Los Angeles vs. Riverside)
- Time (from finding an apartment to signing a lease and moving in)
- Money (spending little on housing vs. a lot on it)
- Space (a large apartment vs. a single room occupancy unit)

At different stages in people's lives, and depending on their preferences, they may prioritize different things. Let's imagine a transgender person is trying to escape a law targeting them in a Republican-controlled state. This means they value location and time highly â€” that is, they find living in a Democratic-controlled state with laws protecting their rights highly, and they find this move urgent. This means that they will likely end up prioritizing one of the following:
- Money: in order to save money, they might room up with multiple people to economize on space in order to save more money.
- Space: in order to increase one's access to space, they might get more money by finding a higher-paying job or dipping into savings.

Similarly, if someone places a high priority on location and space (say, they want a 3 bedroom apartment in Manhattan), they will have two options:
- Spend a lot of money (as large apartments in Manhattan tend to be pricey)
- Wait for a rent-controlled apartment to open up
