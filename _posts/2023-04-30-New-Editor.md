I'm going to see what it's like to use a new editor for my web posts â€” namely, using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This will either work out swimmingly or work out extremely poorly, but we'll see. My thinking is as follows:
- I can go back to NeoVim whenever I need to
- It's worth it to try using a more visual editor, rather than one that is solely based on text, when it comes to making a website post.
- For making notes on books, using a more visual editor is better for me than using a completely text editor

Who knows, maybe I'll end up finding some bugs or some other issues that make using the visual editor more difficult than using a text editor.
