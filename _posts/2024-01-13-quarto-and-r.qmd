I'm testing out how to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) with R and R Markdown, and seeing if it integrates with my website, so I can create posts through it and become better at R while working on homework and whatnot.
```{r}
z_scores <- 1:3
pnorm(z_scores) - pnorm(-z_scores)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
library("actuar")
```

```{r}
mgamma(1:4,shape=10,rate=1)
plot(function(x){mgfgamma(x,shape=10,rate=1)}, from=-0.1, to=0.1, ylab="Gamma MGF")
```
