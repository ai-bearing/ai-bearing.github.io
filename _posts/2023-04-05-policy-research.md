For one of my classes, I'm working on writing a policy proposal related to education and equity, so I'm focusing on housing policy (and how it feeds back into education).
## Research
The nexus with education and equity is multiple-fold:
- According to a study by the [Urban Institute](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27103537/), *controlling for socioeconomic status*, household overcrowding in adolescence has a negative effect on student outcomes.
- Almost [30%](https://www.ppic.org/publication/geography-of-child-poverty-in-california/) of children in Los Angeles County are in poverty — and safety net expansions (regardless of level of government) are less effective in areas with high housing costs.
- Child poverty [negatively affects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528798/) educational outcomes.
- Given the effects of poverty (which is exacerbated by high cost of living) on student outcomes, and the effects of household overcrowding, it would be worthy for policymakers to focus on housing costs if they desire improving student outcomes and reducing poverty.
- There is ample evidence that Los Angeles is dealing with a shortage of housing — [job growth outpaces housing growth](https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/housing-jobs-los-angeles-california-stessa-rhna-housing-element), [rents over time](https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/los-angeles-ca), and [high rates of household overcrowding](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-19/los-angeles-history-overcrowding-united-states)
- Additionally, we can see that land use policy plays a significant role in housing costs — an [entitled lot](https://therealdeal.com/la/2018/09/07/a-market-grows-for-entitled-la-properties/) in Los Angeles fetched a [large premium](https://therealdeal.com/la/2018/09/07/a-market-grows-for-entitled-la-properties/) after it was entitled.
- Land use policy is also particularly effective because local governments are in charge of it, as opposed to state and federal governments, who have more effect on safety net policy. There is much research showing that [land use rules affect housing costs](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/research-and-policy/land-use-politics-housing-costs-and-segregation-in-california-cities/), and that

## Focuses and Case Studies

Every policy must be piloted, so, we will try to focus on educational outcomes in areas with the following characteristics:
- High poverty
- High population density
- Low building envelope (determined through the general plan or zoning code)
- Low academic performance
- High rates of student transiency (proxy is proportion of elementary school students who do not complete the school year)

It's important that, whenever a pilot is started, we look at the effect on student outcomes in a dynamic manner:
- Effect on incomes of families who live in the area after the proposed policy change.
- Effect on students in poverty in the schools during and after the policy change.
- Effect on students who moved out after the policy change.

Luckily, state housing laws provide some measure of assurance that this kind of data collection can be done — namely, Senate Bill 330 maintains that any tenants who are displaced in the process of construction are entitled to return to a new unit of comparable quality in the new building. 

Upon identification of census tracts with the above characteristics, we recommend looking into student outcomes after implementing the treatment policy in a 5 mile radius.
## Eventual Goal
The eventual goal is to lift the vast majority of zoning restrictions, with the aim of using these levers to improve student outcomes. The concept of a city without a comprehensive zoning code (or a very liberal zoning code) is not alien — the city of Houston does not have a comprehensive city-wide zoning code, for example. While there is a mandated general plan in Los Angeles, this does not entail maintaining density and use restrictions to the extent that Los Angeles [chooses to do](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/single-family-zoning-greater-los-angeles).

We will use the case studies to understand the effects of zoning reform on student outcomes, and use these studies to inform future policies. Importantly, it is paramount to study thoroughly — we must examine one set of students' outcomes through time, ideally tracking via some particular method, in order to truly get a full picture of the effects on student outcomes.
