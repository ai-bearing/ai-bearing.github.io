In order to understand the current roadblocks keeping the housing shortage in Los Angeles, I think it's a good idea to understand just how deep this problem goes. NIMBYs are not just a bunch of cranks at the local town meetings in the city — they are at the core of the entire political apparatus. I think a case study of where things stand in Los Angeles is a good idea, in order to see just how rotten and corrupt the entire apparatus has become. This is more of a rant than anything else, but I think it's crucial to see it for what it is.

Let's start with the [racist remarks](https://archive.ph/LL9qN) from the LA Labor Federation tapes. There were three city councilmembers in the tapes: Nury Martinez (who recently resigned), Gil Cedillo (who was voted out in 2022), and, beginning our story, Kevin de Leon. Kevin de Leon was the former state assembly speaker and candidate against Dianne Feinstein in 2018 who became a city councilmember in 2022. He also has many ties with the [AIDS Healthcare Foundation](https://archive.li/dhK99).

The true extent of his ties is unknown, but we do know that he consulted for them for a sum of at least $100,000. You might ask, "how does AIDS Healthcare Foundation have this kind of money," — for example, their CEO, Michael Weinstein, was paid over [$500,000](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/954112121) in 2021. It is quite simple — AHF engages in [medication arbitrage](https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/08/19/powerhouse-aids-organization-faces-scrutiny-for-use-of-federal-money-1147976). They are able to obtain discount-priced drugs and charge the federal government for the drugs at market-rate. With this money, they are able to pay these exorbitant sums for [consultants](https://archive.li/dhK99) such as Kevin de Leon, or [various ballot measures](https://ballotpedia.org/AIDS_Healthcare_Foundation) focusing on rent control and NIMBYism.

One of these NIMBY-focused ballot measures is known as the "Our Neighborhood Voices" initiative, which would [repeal](https://ourneighborhoodvoices.com/) nearly every state housing law. Laws such as the Housing Accountability Act, Senate Bill 330, and Senate Bill 9 restrict the ability of local governments to implement the most egregious restrictions on housing production, and AHF provided the initial burst of funding for this initiative. Aside from AHF, one of the largest donors to the ballot measure was a Los Angeles-area realtor named John Heath.

In addition to donating to the Our Neighborhood Voices initiative, John Heath was also [a donor](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/999492574916116503/1135376714655084594/F2AydniakAIE1br.png?width=1270&height=490) to the current city attorney, Hydee Feldstein-Soto, during her campaign. Feldstein-Soto has been embroiled in a few corruption allegations of her own, related to the [Skid Row Housing Trust](https://archive.li/FRdyU). However, despite this, her office does not appear to be worried about the appearance of impropriety, and hired John Heath. Feldstein-Soto also donated to a previous version of the Our Neighborhood Voices initiative during the 2018–2020 election cycle.

Despite the city attorney having a proven track record of opposing state housing laws, the Los Angeles County Democratic Party still [endorsed](https://www.lacdp.org/candidates) her in the 2022 election. Lest you thought this pattern of opposing housing disappeared during her administration, you are sorely mistaken. Feldstein-Soto is [actively](https://archive.li/sk06f) fighting subsidized housing in Venice alongside newly-elected NIMBY city council member Traci Park, who represents Venice. The Assistant Senior City Attorney who received the complaints about delayed housing? John Heath.

If we want to believe that Los Angeles will make progress on the biggest issue of our time (the housing shortage), we need to consider the entirety of Los Angeles's city government and institutional nonprofits as the enemy. It's not as if they don't know what they're doing — they know exactly what they are doing. Of course, change can happen — but not by electing people through the current institutions. Breaking the stranglehold of Los Angeles's institutional NIMBYism will take state and federal action. Many more councilmembers will go to jail, and many more nonprofits will be implicated in heinous actions in the meantime.
