title: "Exercise Routine with a Busy Schedule"

I need to come up with a true exercise routine, complete with some system to track what exercises I do. Obviously, in my [reflection post](2023-12-31-reflections.md) on 2023, I mentioned that I want to become better at weightlifting and cardio, but as time went on, I realized something even more important — my joint mobility, especially my knee and ankle mobility, is subpar. Also, I am probably going to be taking 20 units instead of 16, meaning that my schedule will be even more busy and I will have to be more disciplined with my time. Thus, maximum benefits for minimal time will be extremely important, as I will have to do a lot of homework.

What I have come up with is, in my view, a good compromise to make sure I get better at cardio while also strengthening my knees and reducing risk of injury. I am assuming that I will sleep from 11 to 7:30. My philosophy is as follows:
- Improving knee and ankle mobility/resiliency is my top priority, so I will try to work it into my routine such that it is essentially non-negotiable. Thus, it needs to be as accessible as possible.
- I'm a bit of a minimalist about strength training — I don't want to spend too much time in the gym throwing around weight and developing tons of muscle mass that will be useless for me seeing as I'm not a bodybuilder.
- I have Ultimate Frisbee on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday, which are very intensive, burst-y cardio, so cardio on my off days _may_ not be necessary, but it'll always be nice to have.

With all that said, I this is my plan:
- Monday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg). This is adapted from Brian Patrick's (Knees over Toes Guy) recommendations for improving knee resilience. The tib raises are especially important as I tend to get shin splints whenever I play frisbee, so I want to be able to strengthen those muscles. This sequence is my method for improving mobility and range of motion on exercises such as the squat.
  - 8:30am or 9am (Cardio): Mile run @ track. I'm trying to develop my endurance so, over time, I think this will increase in duration — my goal is to be able to do a 2 mile run.
  - 4pm–5pm (Weightlifting): Barbell Bench Press, Pull-ups. Because strength is primarily improved via exposure to heavy loads, I will try to load the bar as heavy as I view possible, then work through 5x5 until failure. For pull-ups, I'll definitely require the assistance machine, but I'll still try to work through 5x5 with as minimal of assistance as I think I can manage.
- Tuesday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg).
  - 8pm–10pm (Cardio): Ultimate Frisbee.
- Wednesday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg).
  - 8:30am or 9am (Cardio): Exercise bike for 30 minutes. Meant to be low impact because of high impact cardio the previous day.
  - 4pm–5pm (Weightlifting): Barbell Rows, Deadlift.
- Thursday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg).
  - 8pm–10pm (Cardio): Ultimate Frisbee.
- Friday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg).
  - 8:30am or 9am (Cardio): Either exercise bike for 30 minutes or mile run @ track, depending on knee strength.
  - 4–5pm (Weightlifting): Squats and Romanian Deadlifts. I reserve Squats for Fridays because they are the toughest leg exercises and take the most time to recover from.
- Saturday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg).
  - 8:30am or 9am (Cardio): Mile run @ track.
- Sunday:
  - 8am (Mobility): Tib Raises (2x25) and Split Squats (3x10 per leg).
  - 10am (Cardio): Ultimate Frisbee.
