Mark Paul had a [recent article](https://prospect.org/infrastructure/housing/2023-05-16-economists-hate-rent-control/) at The American Prospect where he discusses why economists are wrong about rent control. It includes some cool and interesting empirical studies that show that the arguments by some of rent control's detractors are, if not wrong, then overstated. I think that Paul is largely wrong — this doesn't mean that rent control is never a good idea, nor that political expediency doesn't demand rent control, but that the arguments he makes are lacking in some rigor. 

Paul believes that rent control does not necessarily yield the two major predictions that orthodox economics suggests of it:
- Housing supply constraints
- Housing supply misallocation

To counter the first argument, Paul points to research that shows that rent control repeals don't lead to new housing construction — but this shows that rent control was not the limiting factor on new housing construction, but rather zoning laws. It does not necessarily mean that rent control doesn't reduce housing supply in a market with low barriers to entry that used to have free pricing. In addition, Paul points to New Jersey, in which he says the following:
> rent control *increased* housing supply (though this was largely attributed to landlords slicing up larger units into smaller ones)

Note here that Paul suggests that rent control led to increased housing supply (to back up his argument), but points to *a* misallocation effect (large units being chopped up into smaller ones) to support it. If the policy reduces the supply of 3 bedrooms and increases the supply of one bedrooms, then it does reduce supply (since 3 and 1 beds are not necessarily substitutes).[^1] Now, of course there is greater supply and misallocation effects from zoning laws, but this is still a misallocation effect that would still have existed in the absence of zoning laws.

Similarly, Paul also argues the following:
> Although it is true that rent control creates “winners” (current tenants) and “losers” (landlords seeking to raise rents), this is no “deadweight loss”

The primary beneficiaries of rent control are incumbent tenants, no doubt, but the losers are not only landlords who sought to raise rents, but new tenants who would have moved into housing that was misallocated such as the aforementioned 3 bedroom apartments. There is an element of truth in the fact that there are many cases where raises in rent are due to increases in land values — but this is an argument for Georgist land taxation, which would share these increased land values with the entire community, not strong rent controls that only benefit incumbent tenants *when they stay in the apartment they are in*.

Paul does note that rent control helps keep people in their houses when an area suddenly becomes more in demand (gentrification). This is correct — however, I would push back on the idea that this is necessarily optimal. As said earlier, the imputed benefit from rent control is not portable, meaning that tenants can only benefit from gentrification (through greater public and private investment) if they stay within their particular unit.

Additionally, in a functioning housing market with liberal zoning, *de*gentrification is the norm — an area with older housing stock becomes inhabited with lower income people. Rent control would reduce the possibility of this process happening, as tenants with higher incomes receive an imputed benefit from *not* moving.

Finally, Paul points to the federally subsidized 30 year mortgage to support his idea that rent control does not cause misallocation.
> That style of mortgage was a [creation](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/working-papers/the-public-option-in-housing-finance/) of the federal government during the New Deal. Homeowners, who skew white and rich, benefit tremendously from the government’s rules, regulations, and subsidies that allow them to pay a fixed monthly sum for housing over 30 years. It’s high time for the government to extend these benefits—and the economic security that comes with them—by adopting rent control to cover all people in the United States.

Of course, I strongly disagree with the idea that the 30 year mortgage is a "benefit" that should be extended. The 30 year mortgage is a source of massive misallocation in the housing market — its primary beneficiaries are single family homeowners in large metropolitan areas, and just as with rent control, it primarily benefits those that stay in place. On the investment side, the ease of 30 year mortgage financing for single family housing compared to other forms of financing means that condominium and other forms of multi-family ownership are severely disincentivized, which is yet another form of misallocation.

Finally, the 30 year mortgage and rent control provide greater benefits to the rich within their respective cohort, because the rich tend to stay in one unit for a longer period of time compared to the poor. Since renters are poorer than homeowners, rent control is generally less likely to be regressive on net than homeownership subsidies, but the same principle still applies.

So, seeing as I'm very critical of the argument within Mark Paul's piece, what is the solution? Well, he states the correct answer at the end:
> To truly transform the housing sector, the United States will need to embrace complementary policies to increase the number of affordable and market-rate housing units, encourage more construction and density through changes to zoning laws, and build millions of units of [social housing](https://theappeal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-case-for-social-housing-2.pdf)—high-quality public housing for people across the income spectrum.

The way cars, food, and technology are affordable is through mass production — and similarly, housing stability (should one desire it) is cheaper through mass production. If rents are stable (or downward trending) in the long term, it's more likely that a tenant is able to demand a lease for a longer term, which is yet another guarantee of stability. This is why building tons of housing through lifting zoning laws is the best guarantee of housing stability, not mere rent control.
[^1]: Weak rent controls (such as CPI + 5%) are not likely to impact allocation or supply that much, as investors generally account for rent increases far lower than these anti-gouging limits when making their decision to build.
